				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Continuing with the discussion of Jesus and the Jewel in the Lotus mantra from a few days ago, we have the final three syllables of the mantra (<em>pad-me hum</em>) to consider. If you missed my last post, which considered the first three syllables of the mantra (<em>Om man-i</em>), you can find it <a href="http://garyguinn.com/2016/01/11/jesus-and-the-jewel-in-the-lotus/">here</a>. In that post, I said that I prefer the translation by the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p>The first two of those final syllables, <em>pad-me,</em> mean <em>lotus,</em> and  the Dalai Lama says that the lotus symbolizes <em>wisdom</em>. Wisdom is a central tenet in the development of Christianity. <span class="st">The old Apostle Paul said that &#8220;<em>the foolishness of God</em> is wiser than human wisdom.&#8221; </span><em>Sophia </em>is the Greek translation of the Hebrew word for wisdom in the Septuagint. In Catholic theology and in Protestant mysticism, <em>Sophia</em> is the wisdom of God.</p>
<p>So, up to this point, we have <em>Om</em>, which is purity of mind, body, and speech; <em>mani</em>, which is compassion or love; and now <em>padme</em>, which is wisdom. <em>Wisdom </em>is simply too abstract to translate into action, so I take the statement in Proverbs that &#8220;the beginning of wisdom is the fear (reverence) of the Lord,&#8221; and I translate &#8220;reverence&#8221; into <em>faithfulness</em> or <em>trust</em>. Those are terms I can see in action. So when I repeat, to myself or with others, the syllables <em>pad-me, </em>I am yearning for faithfulness and trust&#8211;i.e., faithfulness to &#8220;the way&#8221; and trust in the one to whom the way leads.</p>
<p>The final syllable in the Jewel in the Lotus mantra, <em>hum, </em>is translated by the Dalai Lama as <em>indivisibility</em>, or <em>oneness</em>. The indivisibility of method (compassion) and wisdom. But also the inter-relation or inter-being of all creation. All human beings are inter-related. We are, in a very essential way, one. As a species, we like to think of ourselves as separate from, or above, the rest of creation. Yet we were created from dirt (in the Genesis story), consist mostly of water, must constantly synthesize both air and the flora/fauna to live, and reproduce through a process of cell division, just like everything else in creation. When we die, the atoms that made up our physical form return to the storehouse of nature from which other creatures/things come. Oneness.</p>
<p>Often when I pray, I use the simple translations of the syllables of the Jewel in the Lotus as my mantra. <em>Purity, compassion, faithfulness, oneness</em>. Those are all important words/ideas in the teachings of Jesus. They are words that <em>describe</em> Jesus. We are told to be transformed, to have the mind of Jesus. In the beginning, Christianity was not called &#8220;Christianity.&#8221; It was called &#8220;the Way.&#8221; Jesus is the Way. Meditating on the words of this mantra is one of the ways I try to follow the <em>way. </em>I like to think of Jesus as the Jewel in the Lotus, the Compassion in the Wisdom.</p>
<p><em>Purity, compassion, faithfulness, oneness.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most popular Buddhist mantras is known as <em>The Jewel in the Lotus,</em> consisting of a six-syllable phrase that Jesus would have loved. There is some debate about the exact origin of the mantra, but it appeared in Buddhist teachings as early as the 11th or 12th century. A  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra">mantra</a> is like a short prayer, which tends to be a word or phrase that, when repeated continuously in meditation and worship, has a positive spiritual effect on the worshiper. Christianity has its share of verses, songs, and early prayers that have become mantras. Consider, for example, the <em>Jesus Prayer</em> (&#8220;Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior, have mercy on me, a sinner&#8221;), which is used widely in Christian meditation, especially in the Eastern  Orthodox Church. Or phrases from the <em>Gloria (&#8220;</em>Lord God, Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us&#8221;) or the <em>Phos Hilaron (&#8220;</em>O gracious Light, pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven, O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!&#8221;) or the <em>Te Deum</em> (&#8220;Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts&#8221;)<em>. </em>Or hundreds of verses from both testaments of the Bible.</p>
<p>Buddhist Mantras are frequently not literally translatable into English, or only loosely so. <em>The Flower in the Lotus</em> is translated in different ways, but the translation I love is from the Dalai Lama. It is <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/tib/omph.htm">the translation</a> I think Jesus would affirm. In the original language, the six syllables are &#8220;<em>Om Ma-ni Pad-me Hum</em>.&#8221; The syllable &#8220;<em>Om</em>&#8221; is the essential sound in the Buddhist tradition and has a wide array of applications. It&#8217;s the sound you always see/hear a group of monks chanting in any documentary on Buddhism. It is frequently translated for Westerners as the vibration of the Universe/God, which has no literal translation but has great spiritual power. The Dalai Lama translates it in a simple but profound way as purity of mind, body, and speech. I apply this translation in my own meditations as follows: <em>Think</em> only those thoughts that promote the good, the beautiful, the well-being of others; <em>Do</em> only those acts that are healthy for the body and make physical life good; <em>Speak</em> only those words that comfort, build up, and give dignity to other people/creatures. So the Dalai Lama&#8217;s translation of this simple syllable, <em>Om</em>, offers not just a definition of a word, but a way of life. Every time I sound that <em>Om</em>, to myself or with others, I am asking for purity of mind, body, and speech.</p>
<p>The next four syllables&#8211;<em>mani padme</em>&#8211;are generally translated as &#8220;jewel&#8221; (mani) and &#8220;lotus&#8221; (padme), hence the name of the mantra. The Dalai Lama considers the  jewel to be a symbol of altruism, compassion, and love. The lotus symbolizes wisdom. If we want to become like a Buddha, or like Jesus, these four syllables represent the path, the way. Compassion combined with Wisdom. Every time I sound the syllables <em>Mani</em>, to myself or with others, I open myself to compassion&#8211;from the Latin, <em>com + pati (</em>with + suffer) to suffer with. To suffer with those who suffer, to experience the deep sympathy that leads to action to relieve suffering. Consider Paul&#8217;s beautiful hymn to selfless love in I Cor 13.</p>
<p>Well, since I try to keep these postings to about 500 words maximum, I&#8217;m going to deal with the last three syllables of the mantra (<em>pad-me hum</em>), and why Jesus would love the whole thing, in another post, in a few days.</p>
