				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I want to share some news that I hope will interest some of you: In the next week or two, the <a href="http://www.villagewritingschool.com/#sthash.dm0BnPKL.dpbs">Village Writing School</a> will begin publishing a column by me every other week in their on-line Newsletter. Each column will address a single issue faced by writers. The first two columns will look at <em>Conflict</em> and <em>Geography</em>. I&#8217;ll keep them short (maximum of 300 words) and direct. Each column will offer some practical recommendations along with some background theory. I will be posting the columns here on my blog with links to the resources I&#8217;m discussing. If you are a writer, or if you just like to think about what makes writing good, I hope you&#8217;ll join me.</p>
