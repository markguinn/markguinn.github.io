				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here’s the scene: A detective—about forty, rugged good looks, speaks the Queen’s English as if he were once a broadcaster on BBC radio, dark clothing, fashionable hair, divorced, one daughter with whom he struggles to communicate, aging belligerent father from whom he feels estranged—returns from the scene of a grisly murder. He becomes immobilized by depression, nearly catatonic, weeping, whining, never sleeps, lives with a hangover, brilliant at solving crimes, but unbearable as a person. As I see it, this is an accurate description of British actor Kenneth Branagh’s interpretation of the fictional Swedish detective Kurt Wallander.</p>
<p>Long before I stumbled onto the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallander_%28UK_TV_series%29">Branagh BBC series</a> <em>Wallander</em>, I had very mixed feelings about Kenneth Branagh—good in Shakespeare, awful in <em>Frankenstein, </em>and so forth. But as a real lover of Scandinavian crime fiction, I was up for giving the <em>Wallander</em> series a shot. After three or four episodes, I had had enough. Great Swedish settings (cold, dark, wet, but beautiful), interesting stories, good supporting cast, but I could not stomach Branagh’s overblown Existential angst in his interpretation of the title character.</p>
<p>The novels from which the <em>Wallander</em> series was created were written by the late Swedish novelist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henning_Mankell">Henning Mankell</a>, who died in 2015. About a year after I abandoned the BBC series, I ran across an inexpensive used copy of one of Mankell&#8217;s Wallander novels and decided to read it. I was not surprised to find really good writing, which is common with the Scandinavian writers, but was delighted to find a title character who was likeable—middle-aged, average looking, a little out of shape, no black clothes, plain hair, divorced, struggling with his relationships with his daughter and aging father. Pensive, a little brooding at times, but a far, far cry from Branagh’s morose, nearly suicidal cop.</p>
<p>Not long after reading the novel, I found a Swedish production of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallander_%28Swedish_TV_series%29"><em>Wallander</em> </a>series on Netflix and thought, why not? It was a jewel of a series&#8211;in Swedish with subtitles. The Swedish lead actor, Kristor Henriksson, an average looking guy, was a perfect balance between pensive and active, brooding and outgoing. No more weeping and whining, just quiet and thoughtful. Still brilliant at solving murders, but also an interesting person. I&#8217;d say that Henriksson saved my Wallander.</p>
<p>I may not in future watch a Kenneth Branagh production of anything. I will continue to read Henning Mankell’s Wallander novels. If you like crime fiction, you need to introduce yourself to Scandinavian crime fiction. Henning Mankell would be a good place to start. The Wallander novels are good reading, and as a bonus you get the Swedish production of the TV series, which captures the best elements of the fiction.</p>
