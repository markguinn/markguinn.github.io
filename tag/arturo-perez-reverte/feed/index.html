				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How’s this for the opening line of a novel: “The telephone rang, and she knew she was going to die.” Come on, admit it, you wish you had opened a novel that way. I wish I’d written that line as an opening. But Arturo Perez-Reverte wrote it to open his novel <em>The Queen of the South</em>. It’s a pretty good hook line, the kind of line that will buy you at least a few pages from the reader. But only a few. You have to sink that hook deeper and start reeling in the line—get the reader committed to reading the rest of the story. In other words, sometime soon, you had better be offering either some scintillating action (for one kind of reader) or some luscious prose (for another kind of reader).</p>
<p>Maybe one of the reasons that Perez-Reverte’s novels have sold millions of copies in a bunch of languages is that, maybe for a third kind of reader, he does both—after hooking the reader immediately, offering action and style. That third kind of reader wants to be wooed by the language, made love to by the sounds of the words and the beauty of the imagery and the surprise of really interesting characters, but also enjoys the thrill of the mystery.</p>
<p>Perez-Reverte is known as a writer of “intellectual mysteries,” set in specialized worlds such as art restoration, chess, or fencing. The narrator of <em>The Queen of the South</em> is an ex-journalist who has become a novelist, whose latest work, which is biographical, is set in the world of international narcotics smuggling.</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m much more interested in the specialized worlds of art restoration, chess, and fencing than I am the world of international narcotics smuggling, and so this novel has to sell me. Here’s a sentence from page five that helped set the hook for me: “Then she turned toward the rain that was pattering against the windows, and I don’t know whether it was something in the gray light from outside or an absentminded smile, but whatever it was, it left a strange, cruel shadow on her lips.” Okay, I want to know more about that woman. The hook is set and Perez-Reverte is reeling me in. In fact, &#8220;that woman&#8221; is the biographical focus of the narrator. But Arturo Perez-Reverte has long ago convinced me, in three of his other novels, that he will deliver a literary, intellectual mystery, and that I will love it. So I guess I’ll go with him on this one too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just finished reading my second Arturo Perez-Reverte novel, <em>The Flanders Panel. </em>Perez-Reverte&#8217;s novels use many of the standard elements of the mystery genre, but are written in a rich style, beautiful even in translation, and explore the deep humanity of his complex characters. I&#8217;ve started a third Perez-Reverte novel, <em>The Fencing Master</em>, and one of the things I like most about these three novels is that they are all set in a specialized subculture&#8211;rare book collectors, art collectors, professional chess, fencing.</p>
<p>The protagonist of <em>The Flanders Panel,</em> a young woman who does restoration work on classic pieces of art for some of the biggest collectors and art houses in the world, uncovers a long hidden secret about a major Renaissance painting on which she is working. Her world begins to fall apart, and her life is threatened. Her response, as given by Perez-Reverte&#8217;s narrator, intrigues me:</p>
<p>&#8220;Was she really afraid? In other circumstances, the question would have been a good topic for academic discussion, in the pleasant company of friends, in a warm, comfortable room, in front of a fire, with a bottle of wine. Fear as the unexpected factor, fear as the sudden, shattering discovery of a reality which, though only revealed at that precise moment, has always been there. Fear as the crushing end to ignorance or as the disruption of a state of grace. Fear as sin.&#8221;</p>
<p>This paragraph, beautifully written, posits the powerful tension between two ways we experience reality&#8211;emotion and intellect. In this case,  <em>fear</em>, the primitive fear of death, of violence, of pain, is the physical experience. This fear in the protagonist&#8217;s <em>gut</em> becomes anger, the desire for revenge, the fight for self preservation. But that same fear in her <em>mind</em> becomes metaphor&#8211;the &#8220;crushing end to ignorance,&#8221; the &#8220;disruption of a state of grace,&#8221; or, most surprising, &#8220;sin.&#8221;</p>
<p>We all respond to fear on the emotional level with &#8220;fight or flight.&#8221; We respond to fear on the intellectual level with metaphor&#8211;it becomes a bottomless chasm, a stampede of wild horses, or Hell. I wonder whether, as we evolved from pre-conscious beings to beings that are self-aware, our experience of fear began to operate on two levels. The paintings on the cave walls at Lascaux in southern France, over seventeen thousand years old, were metaphors for the visceral experience of hunting large and dangerous animals. Perhaps we make metaphors of our deepest fears so that we can live with them.</p>
<p>What does it mean for <em>fear </em>to be the &#8220;disruption of a state of grace,&#8221; to be &#8220;sin&#8221;? Do we live in the <em>illusion of security</em>, and is the illusion of security the state of grace that is disrupted by the threat of violence or death? If so, then &#8220;state of grace&#8221; is itself a metaphor, a metaphor of an illusion. All of us who have lived beyond our teenage years have come to understand that in this life there is no security, that everyone, from the pauper to the prince, is subject to sudden and unexpected dangers, to violence of various forms, to death. And yet most of us, from day to day, live as if this were not true. An odd way of looking at &#8220;grace&#8221;&#8211;the self-imposed ignorance of the fragile, the delicate, splintery nature of life, that is beyond our control.</p>
<p>Hard not to hear echoes of the story of the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve living in ignorance, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, The Fall as the sudden confrontation with nakedness and death.  John Milton opens <em>Paradise Lost</em> with this:  &#8220;Of Man&#8217;s First Disobedience, and the Fruit/ Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal taste/ Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,/ With loss of Eden . . . . Sing Heav&#8217;nly Muse.&#8221; Perez-Reverte&#8217;s <em>The Flanders Panel</em> becomes another version of that primordial story. A paradise lost. And Perez-Reverte? Sing, Heavenly Muse!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m humming, like a tight-wire in a high wind. A few minutes ago I finished reading a book that tasted like honey and red wine, that punched me right in the mouth and dared me not to like it, that made such love to me I cried &#8220;I&#8217;m melting!&#8221; So somebody&#8217;s got to read this book and talk to me.</p>
<p>Arturo Perez-Reverte, a television journalist born in Cartagena, whom I had never read and didn&#8217;t know existed, has written three novels, and now I want to read the other two. This novel, <em>The Club Dumas</em>, is a bibliophile&#8217;s delight&#8211;a literary mystery set in the underworld of serious book collectors and the mercenaries who serve them, with a strong dose of the occult thrown in. The title alludes to the 19th-century French writer Alexandre Dumas, whose book <em>The Three Musketeers </em>plays an important role in the novel. The style reminds me of the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges and his labyrinths, cerebral, really smart writing, though this story is more accessible than some of Borges. And the characters are more human, more loveable than Borges&#8217; tend to be.</p>
<p>I really like the main character, Lucas Corso, an imperfect, nearly dysfunctional, hero. Here is part of his introduction: &#8220;Corso was a mercenary of the book world, hunting down books for other people. . . . Jackals on the scent of the Gutenberg Bible, antique fair sharks, auction room leeches, they would sell their grandmothers for a first edition.&#8221;</p>
<p>I found the book at a book sale, decided to give it a shot, and bought it for fifty cents. Don&#8217;t you love it when that happens? Of course, I buy at least five book sale books for every one that turns to gold like this one did. But hey . . .</p>
<p>If you have read <em>The Club Dumas</em>, or if you are tempted to read it and give in to the temptation, let me know what you think. Meanwhile, I&#8217;m going on-line to find the first two novels.</p>
