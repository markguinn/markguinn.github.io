				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the Forge: Conflict in Fiction</p>
<p><em>Forge</em>:  n.</p>
<ol>
<li>A furnace where metals are heated or wrought.</li>
<li>A workshop where pig iron is transformed into wrought iron.</li>
<li>tr.</li>
<li>To form by heating in a forge and beating or hammering into shape.</li>
<li>To give form or shape to, especially by means of careful effort.</li>
</ol>
<p>The iconic writer of spy thrillers John le Carre once said, “’The cat sat on the mat’ . . . . is not the beginning of a story, but ‘The cat sat on the <em>dog’s</em> mat’ is.” Why so? Because a story is not made up simply of action (The cat sat on the mat) but of action that springs from, or leads to, conflict (The cat sat on the <em>dog’s</em> mat).</p>
<p>In her fine book on craft, titled <a href="http://www.thriftbooks.com/w/writing-fiction-a-guide-to-narrative-craft_janet-burroway/246014/#isbn=0321026896"><em>Writing Fiction: a Guide to Narrative Craft,</em> Janet Burroway</a> says “Conflict is the first encountered and the fundamental element of fiction, fundamental because in literature only trouble is interesting.” Consider this. Gossip may be a sin, but if so, it is one of the most widely appealing and practiced sins. Why? Because human beings want to hear stories, especially stories about trouble.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Burning-Down-House-Essays-Fiction/dp/1555975089">Charles Baxter</a>, in <em>Burning Down the House</em>, offers this observation: “Say what you will about it, Hell is story-friendly. If you want a compelling story, put your protagonist among the damned. . . . Paradise is not a story. It’s about what happens when the stories are over.” Not all stories end in Paradise, of course. Many great stories leave the protagonist in Hell, or at least in Purgatory.</p>
<p>Baxter’s <em>Hell</em> is simply human conflict, and his <em>damned</em> simply humans in conflict. Conflict stems from thwarted desire, heartbreaking obstacles, love, joy, betrayal, sex, laughter. A character yearns and struggles to fulfill her yearnings. And in the end, she overcomes, or is overcome.</p>
<p><em>No conflict, no story.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>From the Forge </em>is a Writers’ Column that will be appearing every other week in the newsletter of <a href="http://www.villagewritingschool.com/">The Village Writing School</a> and will also appear on this blog. The posts will be short, around 300 words, and will focus on a single element of creative writing, offering suggestions and examples.</p>
<p><em>Forge</em>:  n., v.tr.</p>
<ol>
<li>A furnace where metals are heated or wrought.</li>
<li>A workshop where pig iron is transformed into wrought iron.</li>
<li>To form by heating in a forge and beating or hammering into shape.</li>
<li>To give form or shape to, especially by means of careful effort.</li>
</ol>
<p>Blacksmiths work metals in a forge. Writers work words in the forge of the mind. In the mind, words are “heated” and “wrought.” We beat them and hammer them into shape. They begin as pig iron, stubborn, resistant to our desires, but with toil they slowly yield. They become the wrought iron of literature.</p>
<p>Number 1<em>: Geography 101</em></p>
<p>In her book <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/making-a-literary-life-carolyn-see/1100266777" target="_blank"><em>Making</em> <em>A Literary Life: Advice for Writers and Other Dreamers</em></a>, Carolyn See says that “by being ‘universal’ we run the risk of boring our readers to death.”</p>
<p>But, wait. I thought good literature was universal, that good literature connects us to what William Faulkner called “the old verities and truths of the heart, <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/10/william-faulkner-nobel-prize-acceptance-speech/" target="_blank">the old universal truths lacking which any story is ephemeral and doomed</a> – love and honor and pity and pride and compassion and sacrifice”? Far be it from me to argue with Faulkner.</p>
<p>But <em>how</em> does a story <em>do</em> what Faulkner requires. Where do writers <em>find </em>the “universal truths”? The answer, of course, is that the “old verities and truths of the heart” are mined from the geography of everyday life. A story is about people who want things, do things, suffer, and succeed or fail. The “old <em>verities</em>” are found in “<em>verisimilitude</em>.” They have to look like life. The quiet room after the door closes. The lipstick smudge on the empty glass. The smell of rotting flesh, or a flower.</p>
<p>See’s advice? “Scratch out a sketch of the town the story happens in, the living room where people sit and talk, the view from the windows, the traffic outside. . . . The more deeply you take charge of [the geography], the more easily you keep the reader enchanted.” I think See means that you, the writer, must <em>inhabit</em> the geography of your story. Close your eyes and breathe deeply, hear the baby cry next door, see the light go out in the second story room. <a href="http://wp.me/p67twg-4g">[Short example]</a></p>
<p>The paradox of great stories, See says, is that “In order to be timeless, [they have] to be rooted in time.” We understand the universal only through concrete reality.</p>
<p>So keep it real.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here’s the scene: A detective—about forty, rugged good looks, speaks the Queen’s English as if he were once a broadcaster on BBC radio, dark clothing, fashionable hair, divorced, one daughter with whom he struggles to communicate, aging belligerent father from whom he feels estranged—returns from the scene of a grisly murder. He becomes immobilized by depression, nearly catatonic, weeping, whining, never sleeps, lives with a hangover, brilliant at solving crimes, but unbearable as a person. As I see it, this is an accurate description of British actor Kenneth Branagh’s interpretation of the fictional Swedish detective Kurt Wallander.</p>
<p>Long before I stumbled onto the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallander_%28UK_TV_series%29">Branagh BBC series</a> <em>Wallander</em>, I had very mixed feelings about Kenneth Branagh—good in Shakespeare, awful in <em>Frankenstein, </em>and so forth. But as a real lover of Scandinavian crime fiction, I was up for giving the <em>Wallander</em> series a shot. After three or four episodes, I had had enough. Great Swedish settings (cold, dark, wet, but beautiful), interesting stories, good supporting cast, but I could not stomach Branagh’s overblown Existential angst in his interpretation of the title character.</p>
<p>The novels from which the <em>Wallander</em> series was created were written by the late Swedish novelist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henning_Mankell">Henning Mankell</a>, who died in 2015. About a year after I abandoned the BBC series, I ran across an inexpensive used copy of one of Mankell&#8217;s Wallander novels and decided to read it. I was not surprised to find really good writing, which is common with the Scandinavian writers, but was delighted to find a title character who was likeable—middle-aged, average looking, a little out of shape, no black clothes, plain hair, divorced, struggling with his relationships with his daughter and aging father. Pensive, a little brooding at times, but a far, far cry from Branagh’s morose, nearly suicidal cop.</p>
<p>Not long after reading the novel, I found a Swedish production of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallander_%28Swedish_TV_series%29"><em>Wallander</em> </a>series on Netflix and thought, why not? It was a jewel of a series&#8211;in Swedish with subtitles. The Swedish lead actor, Kristor Henriksson, an average looking guy, was a perfect balance between pensive and active, brooding and outgoing. No more weeping and whining, just quiet and thoughtful. Still brilliant at solving murders, but also an interesting person. I&#8217;d say that Henriksson saved my Wallander.</p>
<p>I may not in future watch a Kenneth Branagh production of anything. I will continue to read Henning Mankell’s Wallander novels. If you like crime fiction, you need to introduce yourself to Scandinavian crime fiction. Henning Mankell would be a good place to start. The Wallander novels are good reading, and as a bonus you get the Swedish production of the TV series, which captures the best elements of the fiction.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://www.noemipress.org/catalog/poetry/parker/">The Locust Diagrams</a>, </em>Nate Parker&#8217;s first book of poetry, from Noemi Press, is a wild and surprising romp through language and imagery. If your tastes tend toward traditional, rhymed, easily accessible poetry, then <em>The Locust Diagrams</em> will not make you happy. But if your tastes have a ragged edge, if you believe that sometimes poetry has to surprise you into loving it, and if you like a little twisted humor, then Nate&#8217;s first book is for you. Here are the opening lines of the first poem in the collection, &#8220;Tender&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;how we eat      glazed donuts/ on the          traintracks/</p>
<p>over the river,   share dark/ bean coffee      while larks/</p>
<p>headbutt      our sugary feet/ &amp; sunlight fills   the woods/</p>
<p>&amp; sears                    the dew.&#8221;</p>
<p>These seven lines are packed with beauty and surprise. Sharing donuts on the train tracks &#8220;while larks/ headbutt our sugary feet.&#8221; What a beautiful surprise of an image, but it&#8217;s followed by a very traditional image&#8211;&#8220;sunlight fills the woods&#8221;&#8211;which then turns into another stunning surprise when the sunlight &#8220;sears&#8221; the dew. The choice of that verb, &#8220;sears,&#8221; in that situation is the mark of a really fine poet. It surprises and at the same time is the perfect word.</p>
<p>One more example, the opening lines of  a poem titled &#8220;Children Camping&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;wind out of Michigan/ shoots/ pine needles</p>
<p>into a light pink/ fat rapt/ creek,</p>
<p>sweetening it down to its slugs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the images are a fun mixture of traditional and startling. The wind out of Michigan doesn&#8217;t &#8220;blow&#8221; the pine needles; it &#8220;shoots&#8221; them into the creek&#8211;a &#8220;light pink fat rapt creek&#8221; no less&#8211;and the needles sweeten the creek &#8220;down to its slugs.&#8221; The verbs &#8220;shoots&#8221; and &#8220;sweetening&#8221; here, like the verb &#8220;shears&#8221; in the earlier example, are more marks of real poetic vision.</p>
<p>Some of the poems in the collection are more abstract, more post traditional, in form and language than the examples above. But the beauty, the surprise, the unusual, sometimes eccentric, view of the world is always there.</p>
<p>Support poetry. Get a copy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year, Southern poet <a href="http://www.nickolebrown.com/about">Nickole Brown</a> published <em>Fanny Says</em>, an anthology that has been called &#8220;an unleashed love song to her grandmother,&#8221; who has left behind a presence as large as the living person. The early sections of the book speak with the voice of Fanny, a grandmother who was larger than life. Some of the poems in the final section speak with the voice of the granddaughter left behind, trying to co-exist with the Fanny&#8217;s ghost.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a beautiful anthology. The emotions are sometimes raw. The language is often more than raw. If you are offended by vulgar language, this is not an anthology for you. In fact, if you are offended by vulgar language, this is not a blog post for you. Consider this your f-word warning. Stop reading now.</p>
<p>The first poem of Part I is titled &#8220;Fuck.&#8221; It&#8217;s a very funny rendition of all the artful ways Fanny used the word.  It was &#8220;the f-word made so fat and slow it was basset hound.&#8221; And in Fanny&#8217;s mouth, &#8220;fucker&#8221; became &#8220;a curse word made into a term of endearment.&#8221; Anyone who has loved someone like Fanny will love this poem.</p>
<p>Some of the later poems, the ones that offer up Nickole Brown struggling with the absence and presence of her dead grandmother, are touching without a drop of the saccharine. Her language is like a straight razor that cuts to the bone. One of the poems near the end of the book, titled &#8220;To My Grandm0ther&#8217;s Ghost, Flying with Me on a Plane,&#8221; wrestles with the paradox of not knowing how Fanny would respond to the fact that her granddaughter is a lesbian, not knowing whether love, after all, would be enough. The poem ends with a series of questions that include &#8220;Will you/ come get me, your hair piled high and white, when/ it&#8217;s my time to go? . . . ./ Or ashamed,/ will you turn away your face and hold up/ a shard/ of that mirror,/ showing me/ I&#8217;m going to hell?&#8221;</p>
<p>I love everything about this anthology. The language, the emotion, the wry sense of humor. I love reading some of the prose poems at high speed, being bombarded by voices and images that make it a thrill ride. Mary Ann and I heard Brown read from the book at the Arkansas Literary Festival last spring and bought it afterwards. I&#8217;m pretty sure, after reading it through, that I&#8217;ll read more of her work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How’s this for the opening line of a novel: “The telephone rang, and she knew she was going to die.” Come on, admit it, you wish you had opened a novel that way. I wish I’d written that line as an opening. But Arturo Perez-Reverte wrote it to open his novel <em>The Queen of the South</em>. It’s a pretty good hook line, the kind of line that will buy you at least a few pages from the reader. But only a few. You have to sink that hook deeper and start reeling in the line—get the reader committed to reading the rest of the story. In other words, sometime soon, you had better be offering either some scintillating action (for one kind of reader) or some luscious prose (for another kind of reader).</p>
<p>Maybe one of the reasons that Perez-Reverte’s novels have sold millions of copies in a bunch of languages is that, maybe for a third kind of reader, he does both—after hooking the reader immediately, offering action and style. That third kind of reader wants to be wooed by the language, made love to by the sounds of the words and the beauty of the imagery and the surprise of really interesting characters, but also enjoys the thrill of the mystery.</p>
<p>Perez-Reverte is known as a writer of “intellectual mysteries,” set in specialized worlds such as art restoration, chess, or fencing. The narrator of <em>The Queen of the South</em> is an ex-journalist who has become a novelist, whose latest work, which is biographical, is set in the world of international narcotics smuggling.</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m much more interested in the specialized worlds of art restoration, chess, and fencing than I am the world of international narcotics smuggling, and so this novel has to sell me. Here’s a sentence from page five that helped set the hook for me: “Then she turned toward the rain that was pattering against the windows, and I don’t know whether it was something in the gray light from outside or an absentminded smile, but whatever it was, it left a strange, cruel shadow on her lips.” Okay, I want to know more about that woman. The hook is set and Perez-Reverte is reeling me in. In fact, &#8220;that woman&#8221; is the biographical focus of the narrator. But Arturo Perez-Reverte has long ago convinced me, in three of his other novels, that he will deliver a literary, intellectual mystery, and that I will love it. So I guess I’ll go with him on this one too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Richard Flanagan&#8217;s novel <em>The Narrow Road to the Deep North,</em> which won the Man Booker Prize for Fiction in 2014, describes the incomprehensible horror of a prisoner of war camp along the infamous Burma &#8220;death railroads&#8221; in World War II, and the stunning beauty of human compassion, sacrifice, and love. He offers a deeply complex vision of humanity. The novel is stout stuff, not for the feint of heart, but if you can weather the unblinking treatment of human suffering, the reward comes in Flanagan&#8217;s profound compassion and deep understanding of the human condition&#8211;and in his beautiful prose.</p>
<p>Flanagan&#8217;s title comes from Matsuo Basho&#8217;s late 17th-century travel journal with the same title, describing a 1500 mile journey by foot into the far north of Japan. Basho was a master of the haiku form, through which he communicated the beauty and transience of life and the frailty of all living things. When I was teaching at the university, my World Lit students read Basho&#8217;s journal under the alternately translated title <em>The Narrow Road of the Interior. </em>Flanagan&#8217;s novel has strong thematic echoes of Basho&#8217;s work. Here&#8217;s a very Basho-like statement from deep in the novel: &#8220;Humans are only one of many things, and all these things long to live, and the highest form of living is freedom: a man to be a man, a cloud to be a cloud, bamboo to be bamboo. . . . People kept on longing for meaning and hope, but the annals of the past are a muddy story of chaos only. . . . Of imperial dreams and dead men, all that remained was long grass.&#8221;</p>
<p>I fell in love with the protagonist, Dorrigo Evans, an Australian doctor, when as he lay beside a beautiful woman in the night, Flannagan&#8217;s narrator says: &#8220;A good book, he had concluded, leaves you wanting to reread the book. A great book compels you to reread your own soul. . . . He believed books had an aura that protected him, that without one beside him he would die. He happily slept without women. He never slept without a book.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the magical things about the novel is that it turns a harrowing story about suffering and death in a prisoner of war camp into a book about love&#8211;between men and women and between men caught in an unimaginable horror. Late in the novel, when after the war Dorrigo Evans is meeting with the wife of one of his men who was killed in the camp, she says to him: &#8220;Do you think that&#8217;s what we mean by love, Mr Evans? The [musical] note that comes back to you? That finds you even when you don&#8217;t want to be found? That one day you find someone, and everything they are comes back to you in a strange way that hums? That fits. That&#8217;s beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Richard Flanagan&#8217;s <em>The Narrow Road to the Deep North</em> made me hum, it made me ache, it made me sigh. As a writer, it made me jealous and happy at the same time. If your nerves are steady and your stomach strong, you have to read this novel. It will get hold of you and make you hum.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just finished reading my second Arturo Perez-Reverte novel, <em>The Flanders Panel. </em>Perez-Reverte&#8217;s novels use many of the standard elements of the mystery genre, but are written in a rich style, beautiful even in translation, and explore the deep humanity of his complex characters. I&#8217;ve started a third Perez-Reverte novel, <em>The Fencing Master</em>, and one of the things I like most about these three novels is that they are all set in a specialized subculture&#8211;rare book collectors, art collectors, professional chess, fencing.</p>
<p>The protagonist of <em>The Flanders Panel,</em> a young woman who does restoration work on classic pieces of art for some of the biggest collectors and art houses in the world, uncovers a long hidden secret about a major Renaissance painting on which she is working. Her world begins to fall apart, and her life is threatened. Her response, as given by Perez-Reverte&#8217;s narrator, intrigues me:</p>
<p>&#8220;Was she really afraid? In other circumstances, the question would have been a good topic for academic discussion, in the pleasant company of friends, in a warm, comfortable room, in front of a fire, with a bottle of wine. Fear as the unexpected factor, fear as the sudden, shattering discovery of a reality which, though only revealed at that precise moment, has always been there. Fear as the crushing end to ignorance or as the disruption of a state of grace. Fear as sin.&#8221;</p>
<p>This paragraph, beautifully written, posits the powerful tension between two ways we experience reality&#8211;emotion and intellect. In this case,  <em>fear</em>, the primitive fear of death, of violence, of pain, is the physical experience. This fear in the protagonist&#8217;s <em>gut</em> becomes anger, the desire for revenge, the fight for self preservation. But that same fear in her <em>mind</em> becomes metaphor&#8211;the &#8220;crushing end to ignorance,&#8221; the &#8220;disruption of a state of grace,&#8221; or, most surprising, &#8220;sin.&#8221;</p>
<p>We all respond to fear on the emotional level with &#8220;fight or flight.&#8221; We respond to fear on the intellectual level with metaphor&#8211;it becomes a bottomless chasm, a stampede of wild horses, or Hell. I wonder whether, as we evolved from pre-conscious beings to beings that are self-aware, our experience of fear began to operate on two levels. The paintings on the cave walls at Lascaux in southern France, over seventeen thousand years old, were metaphors for the visceral experience of hunting large and dangerous animals. Perhaps we make metaphors of our deepest fears so that we can live with them.</p>
<p>What does it mean for <em>fear </em>to be the &#8220;disruption of a state of grace,&#8221; to be &#8220;sin&#8221;? Do we live in the <em>illusion of security</em>, and is the illusion of security the state of grace that is disrupted by the threat of violence or death? If so, then &#8220;state of grace&#8221; is itself a metaphor, a metaphor of an illusion. All of us who have lived beyond our teenage years have come to understand that in this life there is no security, that everyone, from the pauper to the prince, is subject to sudden and unexpected dangers, to violence of various forms, to death. And yet most of us, from day to day, live as if this were not true. An odd way of looking at &#8220;grace&#8221;&#8211;the self-imposed ignorance of the fragile, the delicate, splintery nature of life, that is beyond our control.</p>
<p>Hard not to hear echoes of the story of the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve living in ignorance, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, The Fall as the sudden confrontation with nakedness and death.  John Milton opens <em>Paradise Lost</em> with this:  &#8220;Of Man&#8217;s First Disobedience, and the Fruit/ Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal taste/ Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,/ With loss of Eden . . . . Sing Heav&#8217;nly Muse.&#8221; Perez-Reverte&#8217;s <em>The Flanders Panel</em> becomes another version of that primordial story. A paradise lost. And Perez-Reverte? Sing, Heavenly Muse!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The story &#8220;Being a Doaks and All&#8221; was first published years ago in <em>The Rockford Review, </em>and it was included last year in <em>Yonder Mountain: an Ozarks Anthology, </em>published by the University of Arkansas Press. Among my own stories, it has always been special to me, in part I think because it captures not just small-town life in the Ozarks, but also the inherent class divisions that exist everywhere, especially in small towns, where a person&#8217;s sense of self is formed by a  limited number of forces and those forces are powerful.</p>
<p>There are characters like this, a Doaks, everywhere, not just in the Ozarks. To some extent, we are all a Doaks, or have been at some point in our lives. The story is not very long, about a thousand words. Two young people, a chance meeting for only a couple of minutes. The shaping power of futility, fear, impotence, misunderstanding. The way we cope.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to hear what you have to say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being a Doaks and All</p>
<p>By Gary Guinn</p>
<p>The boy was fifteen, tall and thin, uncomfortable in town, where people stared at him, at the faded overalls that hung on him like a sack, at the worn denim shirt, the sleeves not quite long enough.</p>
<p>The girl walked up to him as he stood on the mercantile porch, waiting for Virgil. Her white blouse, clean and pressed, was tucked into the narrow waistband of a gray skirt. The lines of the pleats in the skirt dropped away from the curve of her hips. Her penny loafers were freshly polished.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re a Doaks, aren&#8217;t you?” she asked. “What&#8217;s your name?”</p>
<p>He turned away.</p>
<p>She walked around to face him again, looked up into his eyes, daring him not to answer. “I said what&#8217;s your name?”</p>
<p>He looked at his feet, then glanced at the closed and silent door of the mercantile.</p>
<p>“You don&#8217;t look mean to me,” she said. “Ollie Delphia told me a body might better run up on a rattlesnake in a dry creek than meet a Doaks in close quarters.” Her brown eyes were steady and unblinking. “What&#8217;d she mean by that?” Her lower lip dropped in a moist curve beneath the slight shadow of her nose and the handful of freckles sprinkled high on her cheeks. The arc of flesh beneath her eyebrows rose above the long lashes.</p>
<p>His thin frame leaned slightly toward the alley that ran down the side of the mercantile, as if drawn to it by invisible wires, but he stood rooted to the porch, his face flushed and his ears burning. He remembered the slumped figure of his mama the day Virgil made her drive him to town, the only time he ever remembered her leaving the farm. Job Fincher had looked out the window of the butcher shop next to the mercantile and had come out and stood on the porch and wiped his hands on his bloody apron and looked at her through the windshield and smiled the smile of a man who knows some private joke. She had stayed in the truck, gripped the steering wheel and stared at the hood. The boy wondered if he looked that way now to the girl.</p>
<p>“Nate Farley says you can&#8217;t talk. Is that right?” The girl pushed her lips out. “Well? You can nod your head, can&#8217;t you?”</p>
<p>The words lay heavy in the base of his throat—that his name was Mason, that she was prettier than the women pictured on the covers of the magazines in the rack in the mercantile. He swallowed. Pleasant Varner, the schoolteacher, had stood over him, her arms folded in weary silence, her tired face saying that his resistance must be a perversity of stubbornness. A boy, no matter how shy, could speak out, if only he chose to do so.</p>
<p>The girl waited. His feet were brown with dust, and he wished he had worn his shoes. In the stinging absence of words he looked out at the street, across the square to the hotel, where Willie May Boseman had stood the day her husband Samuel was killed when he fell from the scaffolding there as Willie May waited for him to come down and eat the lunch she had brought. Mason had stood in the open square a few yards away, watching the men work. He remembered the look on Willie May&#8217;s face after Samuel fell, as she stood there without moving, holding the red bandanna, its corners tied up to make a sack for the lunch. The momentary quiet across which he looked at her. During the commotion that followed, he watched the impotent terror on her face as she stood unable to move. He wondered if he looked like that to the girl.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s rude not to answer when you&#8217;re spoken to,” she said, “but I suppose you&#8217;ve never been taught any better, being a Doaks and all.”</p>
<p>The edge of the tongue-in-groove board at his feet warped up slightly, and he raked his toe across it. His eyes began to water, and he looked again at the alley.</p>
<p>“Mason!” Virgil Doaks&#8217; voice from the doorway behind him made him jump. “Quit standin&#8217; around like a jackass. Get in there and get that box of groceries.”</p>
<p>Virgil Doaks, thin and bent, carrying a tight gunnysack of grain on his shoulder, brushed past. His clothes hung on him like a scarecrow tilting in rocky soil. He dropped the sack over the side of the pickup bed and started around the back of the truck, past the bare bulb of the taillight and the rusted tailgate. The boy scrambled through the door of the mercantile to get the box. When he came back out and crossed the porch, he glanced at the girl, who stood exactly where she had when Virgil came out. Her eyes had narrowed.</p>
<p>“I see where you get your manners,” she said and tipped her head slightly toward Virgil.</p>
<p>As the pickup pulled away from the curb, it rattled and whined and spewed a swirl of blue-gray smoke. A thin stream of tobacco juice squirted like a silent exclamation through the truck window onto the street, and Virgil shifted the wad of tobacco to the other side of his mouth as the clutch banged against the bare metal of the floorboard and the gears ground together. On the movie marquee, “Afternoon Matinee 1:30” was spelled out in red slide-in letters. When the pickup stopped at the intersection, it groaned, and the boy watched the mercantile porch vibrate in the side view mirror.</p>
<p>When they got home, he took the box of groceries to the kitchen. His mama was nowhere to be seen. He slopped the hogs and searched the barnyard for eggs, looking in all the usual places—under the tool shed, in the feed trough, behind the broken stanchion, in the glove compartment of the DeSoto behind the barn. And in the hayloft.</p>
<p>He lay at the far end of a mountain of bales. Beside him a gray cat suckled four kittens, their purring vibrating in the heavy air. A fat blue fly buzzed lazily around the egg basket at his feet. He thought about the mercantile porch, about the girl. She asked him his name, and he told her without taking his eyes from hers. “Mason Doaks,” he said. The words came easily, like rain on the river, his voice deep and resonant. She looked down at her bare feet, unable to speak. He smiled and waved the fly away and watched flecks of dust float down the sun slanting through the gable window.</p>
