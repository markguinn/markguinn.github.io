				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Nobody</em> really believes in God—Christians or members of any other faith community. Christians who say, “I believe in God,” actually mean, “I believe in a particular construct of God that was formed by a particular sub-culture’s reading of a book called The Bible.” That is all that can honestly be said about belief in God. The significant limitations inherent in being human prevent us from understanding, much less believing in, qualities like eternity, infinity, the divine—for that matter, the human.</p>
<p>Christians, or members of any other religious community, will not, of course, stop saying, “I believe in God.” There aren’t many good alternatives to “God,” and they tend to range from the impossible-to-say to the impossible-to-understand. You know, something along the lines of “that <em>than</em> which a <em>greater cannot be thought.</em>” That’s endearing. Thanks, Anselm. The very fact that it is called the <em>ontological</em> argument pretty much kills it for me. Then there is Matthew Arnold’s “stream of tendency, not ourselves, which makes for righteousness.” I guess I prefer that to Anselm. At least Arnold makes God the good guy/girl/thing/tendency.</p>
<p>Anyway, you get the idea. “I believe in God” may not be true, strictly speaking, but it’s easy to say, and heck, it would work well under pressure—for example, as a last testimony before the pagans chop your head off. Can you imagine trying to say, “I believe in that than which a greater cannot be thought” as the ax is falling?</p>
<p>So then, why say, “I <em>don’t</em> believe in God; God believes <em>in me</em>”? We all know the well-worn story of the alcoholic or drug addict trapped in a cycle of self-destructive behavior, whose life is transformed because someone else “believed in her/him.” It’s a beautiful story that touches people because it reveals something essential about human nature—that the faith and love of an <em>other</em> might change what seems unchangeable in us. The other believes in “me” and stays with “me” in the brokenness. Sometimes that is transformative.</p>
<p>The most addictive and self-destructive behavior in my life has been believing in God. Growing up in the Bible Belt, in a small Fundamentalist church, in a loving, believing family, there was never a time when I didn’t “believe in God”—by which I mean, of course, that “particular construct of God that was formed by a particular sub-culture’s reading of a book called The Bible.” It is almost impossible in that sub-culture to step outside the paradigm—comfortable and secure, beliefs constantly reinforced by reading a book that has been for all practical purposes deified, and interpreting personal experiences through that (particular) reading. That particular reading of the book and understanding of God was <em>who I was</em>—my identity, my worth—not just now, but for <em>eternity</em>. The investment in getting it right was staggering. Then when I was sure I “had it right,” it was almost impossible to consider, and certainly impossible to accept, any proposition outside that construct. I could not, without unbearable stress on my identity, my worth, and on my <em>eternal</em> relationship to God, risk such immense stakes.</p>
<p>I was, in effect, a Biblaholic. No, a Particular-reading-of-the-book-aholic. I was addicted to the particular way I had come to read the book. And I judged God and other people by that standard. And like an alcoholic or drug addict, under the influence I was able to justify saying and believing some pretty awful things about God and other people. But something inside kept pushing back, insisting there had to be another way. And then a door opened. Perhaps someone was knocking. I think someone was. Somehow I walked through. On the other side was peace. On the other side was all of creation, including me, and it was good. A different paradigm. The addiction and self-destructive behavior began to fade. No need to “get it right” so that I could judge God and other people. A relief.</p>
<p>Now, like all recovering addicts, I guard my heart closely to make sure I don’t relapse. And I remember that, if there is God, the path to God is God’s belief in us. And so—John 3:16 (Gary’s Revised Edition): For God so believed in humanity, that God became human, that everyone who was believed in would have life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Continuing with the discussion of Jesus and the Jewel in the Lotus mantra from a few days ago, we have the final three syllables of the mantra (<em>pad-me hum</em>) to consider. If you missed my last post, which considered the first three syllables of the mantra (<em>Om man-i</em>), you can find it <a href="http://garyguinn.com/2016/01/11/jesus-and-the-jewel-in-the-lotus/">here</a>. In that post, I said that I prefer the translation by the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p>The first two of those final syllables, <em>pad-me,</em> mean <em>lotus,</em> and  the Dalai Lama says that the lotus symbolizes <em>wisdom</em>. Wisdom is a central tenet in the development of Christianity. <span class="st">The old Apostle Paul said that &#8220;<em>the foolishness of God</em> is wiser than human wisdom.&#8221; </span><em>Sophia </em>is the Greek translation of the Hebrew word for wisdom in the Septuagint. In Catholic theology and in Protestant mysticism, <em>Sophia</em> is the wisdom of God.</p>
<p>So, up to this point, we have <em>Om</em>, which is purity of mind, body, and speech; <em>mani</em>, which is compassion or love; and now <em>padme</em>, which is wisdom. <em>Wisdom </em>is simply too abstract to translate into action, so I take the statement in Proverbs that &#8220;the beginning of wisdom is the fear (reverence) of the Lord,&#8221; and I translate &#8220;reverence&#8221; into <em>faithfulness</em> or <em>trust</em>. Those are terms I can see in action. So when I repeat, to myself or with others, the syllables <em>pad-me, </em>I am yearning for faithfulness and trust&#8211;i.e., faithfulness to &#8220;the way&#8221; and trust in the one to whom the way leads.</p>
<p>The final syllable in the Jewel in the Lotus mantra, <em>hum, </em>is translated by the Dalai Lama as <em>indivisibility</em>, or <em>oneness</em>. The indivisibility of method (compassion) and wisdom. But also the inter-relation or inter-being of all creation. All human beings are inter-related. We are, in a very essential way, one. As a species, we like to think of ourselves as separate from, or above, the rest of creation. Yet we were created from dirt (in the Genesis story), consist mostly of water, must constantly synthesize both air and the flora/fauna to live, and reproduce through a process of cell division, just like everything else in creation. When we die, the atoms that made up our physical form return to the storehouse of nature from which other creatures/things come. Oneness.</p>
<p>Often when I pray, I use the simple translations of the syllables of the Jewel in the Lotus as my mantra. <em>Purity, compassion, faithfulness, oneness</em>. Those are all important words/ideas in the teachings of Jesus. They are words that <em>describe</em> Jesus. We are told to be transformed, to have the mind of Jesus. In the beginning, Christianity was not called &#8220;Christianity.&#8221; It was called &#8220;the Way.&#8221; Jesus is the Way. Meditating on the words of this mantra is one of the ways I try to follow the <em>way. </em>I like to think of Jesus as the Jewel in the Lotus, the Compassion in the Wisdom.</p>
<p><em>Purity, compassion, faithfulness, oneness.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most popular Buddhist mantras is known as <em>The Jewel in the Lotus,</em> consisting of a six-syllable phrase that Jesus would have loved. There is some debate about the exact origin of the mantra, but it appeared in Buddhist teachings as early as the 11th or 12th century. A  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra">mantra</a> is like a short prayer, which tends to be a word or phrase that, when repeated continuously in meditation and worship, has a positive spiritual effect on the worshiper. Christianity has its share of verses, songs, and early prayers that have become mantras. Consider, for example, the <em>Jesus Prayer</em> (&#8220;Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior, have mercy on me, a sinner&#8221;), which is used widely in Christian meditation, especially in the Eastern  Orthodox Church. Or phrases from the <em>Gloria (&#8220;</em>Lord God, Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us&#8221;) or the <em>Phos Hilaron (&#8220;</em>O gracious Light, pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven, O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!&#8221;) or the <em>Te Deum</em> (&#8220;Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts&#8221;)<em>. </em>Or hundreds of verses from both testaments of the Bible.</p>
<p>Buddhist Mantras are frequently not literally translatable into English, or only loosely so. <em>The Flower in the Lotus</em> is translated in different ways, but the translation I love is from the Dalai Lama. It is <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/tib/omph.htm">the translation</a> I think Jesus would affirm. In the original language, the six syllables are &#8220;<em>Om Ma-ni Pad-me Hum</em>.&#8221; The syllable &#8220;<em>Om</em>&#8221; is the essential sound in the Buddhist tradition and has a wide array of applications. It&#8217;s the sound you always see/hear a group of monks chanting in any documentary on Buddhism. It is frequently translated for Westerners as the vibration of the Universe/God, which has no literal translation but has great spiritual power. The Dalai Lama translates it in a simple but profound way as purity of mind, body, and speech. I apply this translation in my own meditations as follows: <em>Think</em> only those thoughts that promote the good, the beautiful, the well-being of others; <em>Do</em> only those acts that are healthy for the body and make physical life good; <em>Speak</em> only those words that comfort, build up, and give dignity to other people/creatures. So the Dalai Lama&#8217;s translation of this simple syllable, <em>Om</em>, offers not just a definition of a word, but a way of life. Every time I sound that <em>Om</em>, to myself or with others, I am asking for purity of mind, body, and speech.</p>
<p>The next four syllables&#8211;<em>mani padme</em>&#8211;are generally translated as &#8220;jewel&#8221; (mani) and &#8220;lotus&#8221; (padme), hence the name of the mantra. The Dalai Lama considers the  jewel to be a symbol of altruism, compassion, and love. The lotus symbolizes wisdom. If we want to become like a Buddha, or like Jesus, these four syllables represent the path, the way. Compassion combined with Wisdom. Every time I sound the syllables <em>Mani</em>, to myself or with others, I open myself to compassion&#8211;from the Latin, <em>com + pati (</em>with + suffer) to suffer with. To suffer with those who suffer, to experience the deep sympathy that leads to action to relieve suffering. Consider Paul&#8217;s beautiful hymn to selfless love in I Cor 13.</p>
<p>Well, since I try to keep these postings to about 500 words maximum, I&#8217;m going to deal with the last three syllables of the mantra (<em>pad-me hum</em>), and why Jesus would love the whole thing, in another post, in a few days.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <em>Living Buddha, Living Christ</em>, <a href="http://plumvillage.org/about/thich-nhat-hanh/">Thich Nhat Hanh</a> says, &#8220;Jesus did not say that if your are angry with your brother, you will be put in a place called hell. He said that if you are angry with your brother, you are already in hell. Anger is hell.&#8221; I like that. A lot. It is an intriguing reading of the passage from the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5. Jesus says there, &#8220;You have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, &#8216;You shall not murder&#8217;; and &#8216;whoever murders shall be liable to judgment.&#8217; But I say to you that if you are angry with a brother or sister, you will be liable to judgment; and if you insult a brother or sister, you will be liable to the council; and if you say, &#8216;You fool,&#8217; you will be liable to the fire of hell.&#8221; I have almost always heard this passage interpreted to mean that Jesus was ratcheting up the intensity of the law so that it would be impossible for a person to keep the law, and we would realize that only through grace can we escape the fire of hell. Not just murder will send you there, but anger and insults will, and of course none of us escapes both of those little numbers.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why I like Thich Nhat Hanh&#8217;s reading of Jesus&#8217; words. I&#8217;m with C. S. Lewis all the way on this whole heaven and hell business. To oversimplify just a bit, Lewis saw heaven as the presence of God (Love, Light) and hell as the absence of God (Love, Light). Lewis says that we don&#8217;t just go to these places when we die, we are in them all along. So I understand Jesus, C. S. Lewis, and Thich Nhat Hanh to be saying that any time we step away from Love and Light (and by extension no longer communicate those things to others) we are in hell. And any time we experience Love and Light (and by extension communicate those things to others) we are in heaven. Lewis&#8217;s book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Divorce"><em>The Great Divorce</em> </a>creates beautiful concrete metaphors for both those conditions.</p>
<p>Even Pogo, in the old comic strip, got got it right several decades ago when he said, &#8220;We have met the enemy, and he is us.&#8221; It would be hard to put it more succintly. Thich Nhat Hanh says, &#8220;Our enemy is not the other person, no matter what he or she has done. If we look deeply into ourselves, we can see that their act was a manifestation of our collective consciousness.&#8221; He means that we all have violence, hatred, and anger in us, and it is manifested by some people in extreme ways. This all reminds me of something else Jesus said, that the judgment you use against others will be used to judge you. That is a hard one, as so many of Jesus&#8217; little broadsides are, especially in a time like ours, when every day the violence and hatred are manifested on TV and the internet.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thich Nhat Hanh is changing the way I think and feel about the church. Honestly, I don&#8217;t much like &#8220;The Church.&#8221; Haven&#8217;t for a long time. It is getting more and more difficult for me to love Jesus and follow &#8220;the way&#8221; of Jesus, &#8220;the way&#8221; of grace and peace, and at the same time to call myself a &#8220;Christian.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is especially poignant to me because, as an Episcopalian in America, I am regularly confronted with the judgment of Christians who say something like, &#8220;Episcopalians aren&#8217;t really Christians.&#8221; The little Episcopal parish church I love and belong to is filled with the most sincere, loving, grace-full seekers/believers I&#8217;ve ever encountered. This judgment, then, by other Christians creates quite a disconnect for me with Christianity as it seems to be defined in the culture around me.</p>
<p>Then I read Thich Nhat Hanh&#8217;s words in <em>Living Buddha, Living Christ</em>: &#8220;The church is the hope of Jesus, just as the Sangha [Buddhist congregation] is the hope of the Buddha.&#8221; Okay, I trust Thich Nhat Hanh as a man full of the Spirit of love and grace and wisdom, so I have to step back and think about what he&#8217;s saying. He continues: &#8220;It is through the practice of the church and the Sangha that the teachings come alive. Communities of practice, with all their shortcomings, are the best way to make the teachings available to people. The Father, Son and the Holy Spirit need the church in order to be manifested.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had to mull that one over for a bit. In the end, it does not change my belief that much/most of Christianity has little to do with Christ. The key phrase in Thich Nhat Hanh&#8217;s statement is &#8220;communities of practice.&#8221; The word &#8220;church,&#8221; with a small &#8220;c,&#8221; describes a &#8220;community of practice&#8221; in a particular time and place. I have to ask whether there is such a thing as &#8220;Christianity&#8221; outside of a &#8220;community of practice.&#8221; No, I don&#8217;t think so. There are only communities of practice that are either practicing &#8220;the way&#8221; of Jesus, &#8220;the way&#8221;of grace and peace, or not practicing it. The ones who are not, Thich Nhat Hanh refers to as &#8220;a false Sangha, a false church.&#8221;</p>
<p>I belong to a community of practice, Grace Episcopal Church in Siloam Springs, Arkansas, that is doing all within its power to follow &#8220;the way&#8221; of Jesus. But then I imagine every Christian church in existence would make the same claim. And God is the only Judge. It is human nature to judge others in part by the way others judge us (think of Jesus&#8217; words in Matt. 7: &#8220;<span id="en-KJV-23318" class="text Matt-7-1">Judge not, that ye be not judged. </span><span id="en-KJV-23319" class="text Matt-7-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.&#8221;</span>) I guess it&#8217;s the same with churches.</p>
<p>Thich Nhat Hanh closes this section of teaching with this: &#8220;If the church practices well the teachings of Jesus, the Trinity will always be present and the church will have a healing power to transform all that it touches.&#8221; Amen to that. I just wonder why I had to read Thich Nhat Hanh to hear it. So here&#8217;s my &#8220;take-away&#8221; on this. My concern must be the community of practice to which I belong&#8211;whether it manifests the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and has &#8220;a healing power to transform all that it touches.&#8221;</p>
<p>All the rest is chaff.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thich Nhat Hanh, Buddhist monk, teacher (Thay), and lover of Jesus says, &#8220;When we look into and touch deeply the life and teaching of Jesus, we can penetrate the reality of God. . . . God made himself known to us through Jesus Christ.&#8221; In his book <em>Living Buddha, Living Christ</em>, Thay seeks the reality beneath the surfaces of both Buddhism and Christianity. For both religious systems, he says, &#8220;The practice is to touch life deeply so that the Kingdom of God becomes a reality. This is not a matter of devotion. It is a matter of practice.&#8221;</p>
<p>In mid-August, I spent a week in solitude at Saint Scholastica Monastery in Fort Smith, Arkansas. My room at the retreat center was isolated from everyone else on the campus. Three times each day, at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, I left my room and attended prayers with the 24 sisters who came together to sing and read psalms, prayers, and praises. Sister Madeline shepherded me along the way, demonstrating the art and practice of Benedictine hospitality. During the services, I sat in the corner and listened to that group of women, who had devoted their lives to the service and worship of God, some from the age of fifteen, now in their seventies and eighties. I left the nave of the church each time feeling I had experienced a little touch of heaven, of the eternal angelic lifting of voices and hearts to the Divine. The feathery soft voices, the antiphonal call and response that anchors their days, year after year. The energy of the Holy Spirit lifted on soft wings.</p>
<p>The great desire of a Christian is to become a Christ. In its earliest use, the word &#8220;Christian&#8221; meant &#8220;little Christ.&#8221; Little Christs want to grow up to be big Christs. The great desire of a Buddhist is to become a Buddha. One meaning of the common Buddhist term &#8220;Bodhisattva&#8221; is simply someone who is on the path to enlightenment, the path to Buddha-hood. A little Buddha wanting to grow up to be a big Buddha. We have that in common. Little Christs, little Buddhas trying to grow up into big Christs, big Buddhas. Thay says, &#8220;We must practice living deeply, loving, and acting with charity if we wish to truly honor Jesus. The way is Jesus Himself and not just some idea of Him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Through this practice we &#8220;penetrate the door and enter the abode of the living Buddha and the living Christ, and <em>life eternal presents itself to us.</em>&#8221; For followers of Jesus, &#8220;Because God the Son is made of the energy of the Holy Spirit, He is the door for us to enter the Kingdom of God.&#8221; In the prayers of the Sisters of Saint Scholastica, Jesus is &#8220;the Beloved.&#8221; Three times each day, day after day, year after year, decade after decade. The energy of the Holy Spirit, the Beloved. The door for us to enter the Kingdom of God. Not a matter of devotion, a matter of practice.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s an odd sounding idea for you: <em>Mindful Eating</em>. Think of it in terms of the spiritual side of the Slow Cooking movement that&#8217;s been so popular the past few years. In <em>Living Buddha, Living Christ</em>, Thich Nhat Hanh describes the practice of being completely in the present moment when you eat. I can hear some of you, especially those with young kids, laughing  now. Thay says, &#8220;In Buddhist monasteries, we eat our meals in silence to make it easier to give our full attention to the food and to the other members of the community who are present.&#8221; For the monks, it is a practice of appreciating the pleasure of community and the beauty of food to its fullest, in every moment. So each bite of food is chewed at least thirty times, and the person meditates on the blessing of food, the goodness of it, and feels compassion for those who are hungry.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s an amazing discipline, and when I imagine trying to do it when our kids were little, I too laugh. But Thay&#8217;s larger point in that chapter is about <em>living in the presence of God</em>. He ties that idea to the practice of <em>piety</em>. &#8220;Piety&#8221; is a much maligned word these days, probably due to our misunderstanding and misapplication of the Puritans&#8217; use of it. Honestly, it&#8217;s a word I don&#8217;t like because of its unloving connotations for me. But Thay points out the importance of the word &#8220;piety&#8221; in Judaism, &#8220;because all of life is a reflection of God, the infinite source of holiness.&#8221; Buddhism has a similar concept based on the &#8220;interbeing&#8221; of all things. In the end, Thay defines &#8220;piety&#8221; as &#8220;the recognition that everything is linked to the presence of God in every moment.&#8221; Okay, that is a definition I can love and work with.</p>
<p>The <em>reality</em> is that everything is linked to God in every moment. <em>Piety </em>is our recognition of that reality. Not a one-time recognition, like &#8220;okay, I agree with that.&#8221; Not &#8220;being a believer.&#8221; Jesus said something about the demons believing. The Buddhist concept of <em>mindfulness</em> calls us to orient ourselves each moment to true reality, to be aware&#8211;when we breathe, or eat, or touch someone&#8211;that the Spirit is there, that each moment itself is a gift from God. I think of <em>mindfulness</em> as the <em>mind full </em>of <em>ness </em>(<em>ness</em> being the true nature of things&#8211;God as reality in every moment).</p>
<p>Thay points out that in Christianity the best example of this orientation is the Eucharist. &#8220;When we celebrate the Eucharist,&#8221; he says, &#8220;sharing the bread and the wine as the body of God, we do it in the same spirit of piety, of mindfulness, aware that we are alive, enjoying dwelling in the present moment.&#8221; I would add that it makes me stop and experience incarnation, the presence of God in <em>that</em> moment, in <em>this</em> world.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to finish with one last thought from Thay. After lamenting that humans often, instead of eating mindfully, simply &#8220;ingest&#8221; our worries and anxieties, he says, &#8220;If we allow ourselves to touch our bread deeply, we become reborn, because our bread is life itself. Eating it deeply, we touch the sun, the clouds, the earth, [those things that nourished the grain] and everything in the cosmos. We touch life, and we touch the Kingdom of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so we come full circle, back to Mindful Eating. The Kingdom of God in bread, meat, water, fruit, vegetables, wine. I think that&#8217;s a pretty good place to start.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Touching God</em> sounds like an absurd idea. People commonly claim that God has <em>touched</em> <em>them</em>, but I can&#8217;t remember anyone claiming he or she has <em>touched God</em>. I wonder, why not? If we claim God is alive, and <em>if</em> we are alive, why don&#8217;t we claim to touch God?</p>
<p>In <em>Living Buddha, Living Christ</em>, Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh explores the Trinity and the idea of touching God. Hang with me for a minute while I share a few of his observations. &#8220;When we are mindful, touching deeply the present moment, we can see and listen deeply, and the fruits are always understanding, acceptance, love, and the desire to relieve suffering and bring joy. . . . To me, mindfulness is very much like the Holy Spirit. Both are agents of healing. . . . In the Bible, when someone touches Christ, he or she is healed. . . . When you touch deep understanding and love, you are healed. . . . The Holy Spirit descended on Jesus like a dove, penetrated Him deeply, and He revealed the manifestation of the Holy Spirit. . . . all of us also have the seed of the Holy Spirit in us . . . When we touch that seed, we are able to touch God the Father and God the Son.&#8221; Quite a statement for one of the leading Buddhist voices in the world.</p>
<p>I said at the beginning, &#8220;If we claim God is alive, and <em>if</em> <em>we</em> are alive, why don&#8217;t we claim to touch God?&#8221; Maybe the problem is not whether God is alive, but whether <em>we are alive.</em> Thich Nhat Hanh says, &#8220;We always postpone being alive to the future, we don&#8217;t know exactly when.&#8221; Well, this is nothing new. We are aware of our human tendency to miss today because we are obsessed with the future. But listen to what he says next: &#8220;It is possible we will never be truly alive in our entire life.&#8221; That&#8217;s worth considering. Tolstoy, Thoreau, Gandhi, Julian of Norwich, and other great men and women have turned toward the simplified, slowed-down life to try to &#8220;be truly alive.&#8221; Think of Socrates&#8217; &#8220;the unexamined life&#8221; and so forth. I&#8217;m not prepared to do what those folks did&#8211;become a cobbler, go to Walden, be the Gadfly of Athens, wall myself up in a room. But Thich Nhat Hanh says that even a schmuck like me can be truly alive: &#8220;The technique, if we must speak of a technique, is to <em>be</em> in the present moment, to be aware that we are here and now, that the only moment to be alive is the present moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>So we are back to <em>mindfulness</em>. &#8220;When you are <em>really there,&#8221; </em>he says (my italics), &#8220;showing your loving-kindness and understanding, the energy of the Holy Spirit is in you. . . . When the energy of the Holy Spirit is in us, we are truly alive, capable of understanding the suffering of others and motivated by the desire to help transform the situation.&#8221; Hmm . . . mindfulness . . . being in the moment . . . the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>So <em>is </em>touching God an absurd idea? Do Buddhism and Christianity share something here? Can we touch God if we are not truly alive, and are we truly alive only in the present moment? Do we experience the present moment only through that deep awareness called <em>mindfulness?</em> Can we <em>touch </em>the Holy Spirit by practicing mindfulness (as opposed to the Holy Spirit <em>touching us</em> at any time, maybe the most unexpected and awkward times)?</p>
<p>When it comes to <em>touching God, </em>I am with this faithful Buddhist monk: &#8220;It is not a matter of faith; it is a matter of practice.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a guest voice for you today. I think you&#8217;ll like what she has to say.</p>
<p><strong>Straight and narrow – deep and wide</strong></p>
<p>by Val Gonzalez</p>
<p>The slender, stony track, perilously steep, led to a constricted gate in a rock wall. My shins were bruised, my knees skinned, my entire attention focused on each step.</p>
<p>I awoke with a permeating revelation. But, I’m getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>I, too, am a recovering fundamentalist. I was taught that following Jesus meant following all the rules. Well-schooled in the King James Version, I was instructed not to question. The result of this training has been a lifetime of fear. Because, you see, I have questioned. I have doubted. I have sinned in varying magnitudes setting off minor tremors and the occasional major seism.</p>
<p>In the midst of such a temblor and the accompanying spiritual crisis, I had a revelatory dream in which I was climbing a mountain. In that vision, I was scrambling boulders to the left of the path, on the very edge of the precipice, trying to keep up with my spiritual teacher. On the far right, there was a broad, smooth road that hugged the slope, full of travelers. When, finally, my teacher paused, I called, “why are you so close to the edge?” Smiling, he waved his arm toward the abyss. I had been so intent on the trek, I’d only been minding my steps while he was skipping like an antelope. I had missed what was now splendidly obvious. “Unless you get close to the edge, you’ll miss the view.”</p>
<p>I’ve explored many faiths and, at times, practiced none at all, but I’ve decided to follow Jesus. Now, due to my track record and complementary suffering, I think I’m something of an expert: Rules don’t always reflect the respect, mercy and loving kindness at the heart of Jesus’ teaching. So, my spiritual journey is an individual journey. The straight gate and narrow path won’t allow the security of the herd. It’s a lonely, unsure way. It’s messy; impossible to navigate without stumbles and setbacks.</p>
<p>But, I aim to stay as close to the edge as possible. Because, when I breathe into my fear, and allow courage to swell and love to win, boulder-skipping becomes easier, compassion simpler, and, honestly, that view! It’s heavenly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On a trip to Mt View last weekend, I took along a mindless page-turner to help me relax and wile away the hours on the front porch of the Inn at Mountain View. Michael Crichton&#8217;s <em>Timeline</em>, is a novel about time travel in which four contemporary researchers are transported back to the late 14th century. For me, Crichton is usually boring for about fifty pages as he tries to build some kind of believable setting/background for the tale he is about to tell, and then he turns on the suspense. This book, though it might be boring for more than fifty pages, eventually turns into a good vacation read, 500 pages you can burn through in a day or two.</p>
<p>BUT I was really struck by this little nugget buried on page 359, spoken by the character who is financing all the experiments in time travel:</p>
<p>&#8220;We are all ruled by the past, although no one understands it. No one recognizes the power of the past . . . .</p>
<p>&#8220;A teenager has breakfast, then goes to the store to buy the latest CD of a new band. The kid thinks he lives in a modern moment. But who has defined what a &#8216;band&#8217; is? Who defined a &#8216;store&#8217;? Who defined a &#8216;teenager&#8217;? Or &#8216;breakfast&#8217;? To say nothing of all the rest, the kid&#8217;s entire social setting&#8211;family, school, clothing, transportation and government.</p>
<p>&#8220;None of this has been decided in the present. Most of it was decided hundreds of years ago. Five hundred years, a thousand years. This kid is sitting on top of a mountain that is the past. <em>And he never notices it. </em>He is <em>ruled </em>by what he never sees, never thinks about, doesn&#8217;t know. It is a form of coercion that is accepted without question. This same kid is skeptical of other forms of control&#8211;parental restrictions, commercial messages, government laws. But the invisible rule of the past, which decides nearly everything in his life, goes unquestioned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Okay, Michael Chrichton is not a great literary stylist, but those thoughts about the power of the past&#8211;the <em>coercion</em> of the past, the invisible rule of the past&#8211;are pretty provoking. If someone had said those things to me when I was eighteen, I would have laughed. I was autonomous, in control, and immortal. The past had little to offer and absolutely no impact on me. The future was mine for the molding, and forward was the only direction I looked.</p>
<p>Now, as a 67-year-old retired English professor and writer, I feel more acutely the power of all the things Chrichton mentioned above, but even more so the <em>coercive </em>power of genetics. We are coerced daily by those diabolical double helixes of nucleic acids, handed down by great-grandfathers, great-grandmothers, grandfathers, grandmothers, fathers, mothers. We swim in a shifting nucleotide that pulls one way and then the other. We don&#8217;t understand why we do half the things we do. We are like the poor Apostle Paul&#8211;&#8220;For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.<span class="p">&#8221; The human condition. </span></p>
<p>Ah, well. As a good Episcopalian, I say embrace it. Learn a new stroke. Swim on.</p>
