				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The quiet has a different quality here. It is driven by the rhythm of the surf. The constant washing of the waves on the shore&#8211;not the pounding surf of California, the East Coast, but the lighter, brighter sound of smaller waves. In the mornings, just after sunrise, the waves are subdued. The birds take over, screeching, whistling, chattering. And the doves&#8217; low calling back and forth in the canopy around us.</p>
<p>The sounds don&#8217;t change the fundamental nature of the quiet. We are a mile south of the village of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopkins,_Belize" target="_blank">Hopkins</a> on the southern coast of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belize" target="_blank">Belize</a>, a one hour ferry and three hour bus ride from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caye_Caulker" target="_blank">Caye Caulker</a>. It&#8217;s a small village with only a few shops and bars, maybe three stores. This aging resort with the flamboyant name of &#8220;<a href="http://www.junglejeanie.com/" target="_blank">Jungle Jeanie&#8217;s</a>&#8221; stands alone on this stretch of beach. Whatever nightlife happens in Hopkins does not reach us down the coast. A little further south, several large resorts claim a half mile of shoreline, but their noise also does not register here.</p>
<p>We play a little, relax a lot. We zip lined in the jungle, visited Mayan ruins, kayaked, and paddle boarded. We should have snorkeled, alas. But the deck of the little cabana, pink and stilted, twenty yards from the surf, kept calling us back, luring us into naps and books and cold Belikin Beer, and occasional glasses of One Barrel rum, made in Belize. Or the chair on the beach as the sun set behind us. The frigate-birds, pelicans, sea gulls, and herons. The fish and chicken and pork and rice and beans and plantains and fry jacks and tortillas.</p>
<p>We walk up the surf line to Sandy Beach Restaurant, a half mile or so, where Ms Merlene, a sweet old Belizean woman, grills &#8220;Jack&#8221; fish and serves rice molded into a heart, and beans, always beans, and Belikin Beer. The hot sauce is made by the &#8220;Sandy Beach Women&#8217;s Cooperative Society, Limited,&#8221; Ms Merlene Castillo, Chair Lady. Her beautiful gap-toothed smile and colorful headscarf. We buy a bottle.</p>
<p>And Barbara, an old hippy, living in an ancient school bus a hundred yards off the beach among the palm and papaya trees. Her tiny shop in the front of the bus, &#8220;Sew Much Hemp,&#8221; where she sells hand-sewn hemp clothing and essential oils and natural bug repellent. The smell of citronella and fabric, her gravelly voice and leathery skin, the old dog at the door whining for a touch.</p>
<p>Tonight our last hurrah. A bike ride up to the village for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garifuna_people" target="_blank">Garifuna</a> drumming. No matter how loud the cabana deck calls me, I&#8217;m going to hear the Garifuna drumming.</p>
<p>Tomorrow Belize City. Thursday home.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The sea breeze runs through the palms, and the palm fronds whisper and chitter above us. A fresh wind that cools the skin. Sun bright on the water, shades of aquamarine, stretching out to the barrier reef, a long white line of surf before the dark blue deep. Sitting, looking, breathing is a sensual experience. The scent of the sea, the white sand, the scattered kelp along the shore. Our last day on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caye_Caulker">Caye Caulker.</a></p>
<p>Every morning dark Belizean coffee from Maureen at Ice-n-Beans, just behind the grove of palms we idle under. Just before noon a Bellikin Beer, Belize&#8217;s own brew, to cool our palate, stir the belly for lunch. Street vendors&#8211;Kareem at his grill, Raul at his cart, Andre and Chenille at their shack by the street&#8211;the food so good we moan and groan as we eat. Chicken and pork and rice and beans and slaw and plantains and homemade tortillas&#8211;we buy one plate, eat our fill, and give leftovers to the dogs. Five American dollars, nine at the most. Always the talk and laughter with the vendors, and walking away feeling sweet, alive.</p>
<p>Each night the old wooden dock jutting out through the mangroves on the back side of the island into open water. A dozen people sitting and talking quietly, watching the sun slip slowly into the water beyond the sailboats anchored in the bay. A round surge of orange, a bright trail running toward us, the scattered dark grey clouds tinged with pink and red. A Belizean man standing in a flat skiff paddles by, framed by the scene, cameras clicking from the dock.</p>
<p>And tonight, Maurice, a wizard with blackened snapper, honey-brandy sauce, and grilled vegetables, here at Wish Willy&#8217;s in the yard of the cabana. Red and white strings of lights laced above the tables. Music drifting, easy laughter, the smoke from the grill, the aroma of chicken and fish. Everyone sipping a Bellikin. Maurice cruising, slow, keeping it going for thirty people. Island life.</p>
<p>Tomorrow the ferry to the mainland, Belize City, then a bus down to Hopkins, a village on the southern coast, south of Dangriga. I miss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caye_Caulker">Caye Caulker</a>. It got under our skin. That first morning, a week ago, when I woke up and stepped out onto the porch, Marvin, big smile and dreads, raking the sand, said to me, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, be happy.&#8221; So we didn&#8217;t, and we were.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we wake, birds whistle and chirp and screech, a dog barks from somewhere nearby, and the sun lights the top of the palm tree at Wish Willy&#8217;s, the outdoor restaurant in front of the cabana. The mosquito net over the bed billows inward, pushed by the fan we keep aimed our direction most nights. I listen for a while, then get up and make  coffee, rummage around for a little breakfast. Caye Caulker.</p>
<p>Mary Ann gets up, I get a cup of coffee, and we go to the front porch of the cabana, check our email, think about riding bikes down to the south end of the island. Caye Caulker is 4 miles long and 650 yards wide at its widest. The caye is split about halfway down by a water passage cut by Hurricane Hattie. The split, about fifty yards wide, frames the north end of the village, where we are staying. So we are at the northern tip of the southern half of the caye. The Lazy Lizard, an over-the-top tourist bar that we avoid, sits right on the split, a really nice area for swimming.</p>
<p>Maurice, a big Belizean with the standard dreads, who owns and runs Wish Willy&#8217;s and is the husband of Monique, our landlady, comes down the steps from their apartment above the restaurant and gives us a big piece of dark, super rich chocolate cake with pecan sauce, warm and chewy. A mouth explosion that reorients the world for a few seconds. So that&#8217;s where he got the belly. Well earned.</p>
<p>Monique&#8217;s dog Scruffy lies on the porch at our feet. One of three that roam the property, all good natured and keen to be petted. We love that Caye Caulker is so laid back and low key about everything. Development is encroaching here, but the streets are all still sand/dirt, there are no cars, just golf carts, and we can eat at small street stands or from street vendors with just a grill on the side of the road. Lovely local food.</p>
<p>Colors. We love the colors. Bright pink, rich blue, turquoise, startling orange and yellow, green. The houses, shops, signs. The old wood plank docks jutting into the ocean from the sand. The still, green water at the shore, the white line of surf at the barrier reef, the dark blue of the deep water beyond. Sitting in canvas chairs in the shade of a palm at the beach, reading, dozing, looking, walking in the shallows, looking. Morning on the Caye. Di island, Mon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I  ask myself how independent, as an individual, I really am on Independence Day. The overwhelming social and cultural pressure on the July 4th holiday is not to be independent or to think independently, but to conform. And that conformity tends to be packaged in a very small box and labeled &#8220;patriotic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our word <em>patriot </em>comes from the Greek <em>patriotes, </em>through Latin and medieval French, and meant simply &#8220;fellow countryman.&#8221; Actually, the Greeks applied the word &#8220;patriotes&#8221; to barbarians. By the 17th century the word <em>patriot</em> had come to mean &#8220;loyal and disinterested supporter of one&#8217;s country,&#8221; but then lost favor again, being applied to troublemakers by the early 19th century. In the 20th century the word was revived with its current positive connotations, especially in American English.</p>
<p class="foreign">So, historically the heart of the word <em>patriot</em> is &#8220;fellow countryman,&#8221; or the people with which you live in a broad community and with which you identify. Based on this fact, a box with the label <em>patriotic</em> should not be a small box, but a very big box, one that includes a commitment to the well-being of all those who live in our country. So a <em>patriot</em> would be one who works tirelessly for good education for all in the country, a decent living wage for all in the country, healthy food and wholesome living conditions for all in the country, programs that promote health, fitness, and emotional well being for all in the country, laws that insure dignity and justice for all and prevent the abuse of power for all in the country, programs that offer a safety net to protect those who struggle to make it on their own, including the elderly, the mentally ill, and those who are broken by circumstances beyond their control. On the other hand, a <em>patriot</em> would also be one who challenges those whose ideas conflict with the truths that the writers of the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html" target="_blank">Declaration of Independence</a> considered &#8220;<em>self evident,</em><em> that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&#8221; </em>A <em>patriot</em> would challenge those who promote the good of only the powerful and rich, or throw up obstacles to accessing the freedom and opportunities that are available, or exclude people from those opportunities based on race, religion, sexual identity, and other differences.</p>
<p class="foreign">How have we come to believe that patriotism is first and foremost a matter of waving a flag, or spending trillions on the military, or bashing anyone who says otherwise, or blindly promoting the United States over all other countries in the world, regardless of the facts of any situation? We should never minimize the sacrifice of those who have died in conflict for their countrymen. Theirs is often called the &#8220;ultimate&#8221; sacrifice. Because I am a patriot, their fellow countryman, I am committed not to &#8220;my country right or wrong&#8221; but to holding our government accountable for the lives of my countrymen, because our government is no less likely than any other government to send them to their deaths for the wrong reasons, to be influenced by greed and the lust for power. By not keeping our government and ourselves accountable for every life in our country, we simply make the abuse of immense power easier.</p>
<p class="foreign">So on this 4th of July I offer this blog post, and later I will be a patriot by eating with a few fellow countrymen/women and hopefully being thankful for, and re-commiting myself to, not just freedom but opportunity, dignity, and well-being&#8211;life and happiness&#8211;for all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a guest voice for you today. I think you&#8217;ll like what she has to say.</p>
<p><strong>Straight and narrow – deep and wide</strong></p>
<p>by Val Gonzalez</p>
<p>The slender, stony track, perilously steep, led to a constricted gate in a rock wall. My shins were bruised, my knees skinned, my entire attention focused on each step.</p>
<p>I awoke with a permeating revelation. But, I’m getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>I, too, am a recovering fundamentalist. I was taught that following Jesus meant following all the rules. Well-schooled in the King James Version, I was instructed not to question. The result of this training has been a lifetime of fear. Because, you see, I have questioned. I have doubted. I have sinned in varying magnitudes setting off minor tremors and the occasional major seism.</p>
<p>In the midst of such a temblor and the accompanying spiritual crisis, I had a revelatory dream in which I was climbing a mountain. In that vision, I was scrambling boulders to the left of the path, on the very edge of the precipice, trying to keep up with my spiritual teacher. On the far right, there was a broad, smooth road that hugged the slope, full of travelers. When, finally, my teacher paused, I called, “why are you so close to the edge?” Smiling, he waved his arm toward the abyss. I had been so intent on the trek, I’d only been minding my steps while he was skipping like an antelope. I had missed what was now splendidly obvious. “Unless you get close to the edge, you’ll miss the view.”</p>
<p>I’ve explored many faiths and, at times, practiced none at all, but I’ve decided to follow Jesus. Now, due to my track record and complementary suffering, I think I’m something of an expert: Rules don’t always reflect the respect, mercy and loving kindness at the heart of Jesus’ teaching. So, my spiritual journey is an individual journey. The straight gate and narrow path won’t allow the security of the herd. It’s a lonely, unsure way. It’s messy; impossible to navigate without stumbles and setbacks.</p>
<p>But, I aim to stay as close to the edge as possible. Because, when I breathe into my fear, and allow courage to swell and love to win, boulder-skipping becomes easier, compassion simpler, and, honestly, that view! It’s heavenly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Living Buddha, Living Christ </em>is the title of a book written in 1995 by a Vietnamese Buddhist monk named Thich Nhat Hanh, who has a world-wide following as a voice for peace. Very early in the book, he says that his &#8220;path to discovering Jesus as one of my spiritual ancestors was not easy.&#8221; Nobody should be surprised to find that the reason for this difficulty was the aggressive  and sometimes violent treatment of Buddhists by Christians in their attempt to &#8220;spread the gospel&#8221; in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Thay (Teacher, which is what his friends and students call Thich Nhat Hanh) says, &#8220;It was only later, through friendships with Christian men and women who truly embody the spirit of understanding and compassion of Jesus, that I have been able to touch the depths of Christianity.&#8221; These people, he says, &#8220;have made me feel that Lord Jesus is still here with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder how many of us can say something very similar to this. I  certainly can. I am able to believe in God only because of knowing people who embody Christ. I created quite a stir a year ago, near the end of a four-year study of Old and New Testaments, church history, and theology, by saying flatly, &#8220;Nothing good has ever come out of theology.&#8221; I had come to believe that theology, as it has been practiced by every religion that I&#8217;m aware of, has led to division and violence within religious communities. I&#8217;m not ignoring the fact that theology has the potential to lead people to do loving, compassionate things, as would the study of Matt 25 or James 2. But the history of the church is in large part the history of powerful men and groups of men (and usually only men) using theology to alienate, exile, and do violence against men (and women) who disagreed with their reading of the Bible.</p>
<p>As Thay says, it can be harder to have an honest and loving dialogue within one&#8217;s own religious community/tradition than with a different community/tradition. I confess that this is one of my own biggest struggles&#8211;to love, accept, and listen deeply to those in the Christian community who are at the other end of the spectrum from me. As a very liberal/progressive believer, I fall easily into the trap of dismissing very conservative believers (which most of the people from my early life are) as simply heartless and legalistic and narrow minded. I said this was a confession, didn&#8217;t I? But Thay says, &#8220;By respecting the differences within our own church and seeing how these differences enrich one another, we are more open to appreciating the richness and diversity of other traditions.&#8221; In other words, I may not be able to truly appreciate Buddhism if I cannot appreciate and value Christian conservatism.</p>
<p>I think this is where I say to conservatives, &#8220;Forgive me for not listening deeply and not opening my mind to consider what you have to say.&#8221; There. We have all heard that confession is good for the soul, so my soul is a little better now. Thank you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to continue to share from my responses to Thay&#8217;s beautiful book. I&#8217;d love to hear from you. Feel free to re-post any of these discussions.</p>
