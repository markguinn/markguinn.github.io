				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the Forge: Conflict in Fiction</p>
<p><em>Forge</em>:  n.</p>
<ol>
<li>A furnace where metals are heated or wrought.</li>
<li>A workshop where pig iron is transformed into wrought iron.</li>
<li>tr.</li>
<li>To form by heating in a forge and beating or hammering into shape.</li>
<li>To give form or shape to, especially by means of careful effort.</li>
</ol>
<p>The iconic writer of spy thrillers John le Carre once said, “’The cat sat on the mat’ . . . . is not the beginning of a story, but ‘The cat sat on the <em>dog’s</em> mat’ is.” Why so? Because a story is not made up simply of action (The cat sat on the mat) but of action that springs from, or leads to, conflict (The cat sat on the <em>dog’s</em> mat).</p>
<p>In her fine book on craft, titled <a href="http://www.thriftbooks.com/w/writing-fiction-a-guide-to-narrative-craft_janet-burroway/246014/#isbn=0321026896"><em>Writing Fiction: a Guide to Narrative Craft,</em> Janet Burroway</a> says “Conflict is the first encountered and the fundamental element of fiction, fundamental because in literature only trouble is interesting.” Consider this. Gossip may be a sin, but if so, it is one of the most widely appealing and practiced sins. Why? Because human beings want to hear stories, especially stories about trouble.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Burning-Down-House-Essays-Fiction/dp/1555975089">Charles Baxter</a>, in <em>Burning Down the House</em>, offers this observation: “Say what you will about it, Hell is story-friendly. If you want a compelling story, put your protagonist among the damned. . . . Paradise is not a story. It’s about what happens when the stories are over.” Not all stories end in Paradise, of course. Many great stories leave the protagonist in Hell, or at least in Purgatory.</p>
<p>Baxter’s <em>Hell</em> is simply human conflict, and his <em>damned</em> simply humans in conflict. Conflict stems from thwarted desire, heartbreaking obstacles, love, joy, betrayal, sex, laughter. A character yearns and struggles to fulfill her yearnings. And in the end, she overcomes, or is overcome.</p>
<p><em>No conflict, no story.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>From the Forge </em>is a Writers’ Column that will be appearing every other week in the newsletter of <a href="http://www.villagewritingschool.com/">The Village Writing School</a> and will also appear on this blog. The posts will be short, around 300 words, and will focus on a single element of creative writing, offering suggestions and examples.</p>
<p><em>Forge</em>:  n., v.tr.</p>
<ol>
<li>A furnace where metals are heated or wrought.</li>
<li>A workshop where pig iron is transformed into wrought iron.</li>
<li>To form by heating in a forge and beating or hammering into shape.</li>
<li>To give form or shape to, especially by means of careful effort.</li>
</ol>
<p>Blacksmiths work metals in a forge. Writers work words in the forge of the mind. In the mind, words are “heated” and “wrought.” We beat them and hammer them into shape. They begin as pig iron, stubborn, resistant to our desires, but with toil they slowly yield. They become the wrought iron of literature.</p>
<p>Number 1<em>: Geography 101</em></p>
<p>In her book <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/making-a-literary-life-carolyn-see/1100266777" target="_blank"><em>Making</em> <em>A Literary Life: Advice for Writers and Other Dreamers</em></a>, Carolyn See says that “by being ‘universal’ we run the risk of boring our readers to death.”</p>
<p>But, wait. I thought good literature was universal, that good literature connects us to what William Faulkner called “the old verities and truths of the heart, <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/10/william-faulkner-nobel-prize-acceptance-speech/" target="_blank">the old universal truths lacking which any story is ephemeral and doomed</a> – love and honor and pity and pride and compassion and sacrifice”? Far be it from me to argue with Faulkner.</p>
<p>But <em>how</em> does a story <em>do</em> what Faulkner requires. Where do writers <em>find </em>the “universal truths”? The answer, of course, is that the “old verities and truths of the heart” are mined from the geography of everyday life. A story is about people who want things, do things, suffer, and succeed or fail. The “old <em>verities</em>” are found in “<em>verisimilitude</em>.” They have to look like life. The quiet room after the door closes. The lipstick smudge on the empty glass. The smell of rotting flesh, or a flower.</p>
<p>See’s advice? “Scratch out a sketch of the town the story happens in, the living room where people sit and talk, the view from the windows, the traffic outside. . . . The more deeply you take charge of [the geography], the more easily you keep the reader enchanted.” I think See means that you, the writer, must <em>inhabit</em> the geography of your story. Close your eyes and breathe deeply, hear the baby cry next door, see the light go out in the second story room. <a href="http://wp.me/p67twg-4g">[Short example]</a></p>
<p>The paradox of great stories, See says, is that “In order to be timeless, [they have] to be rooted in time.” We understand the universal only through concrete reality.</p>
<p>So keep it real.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Nobody</em> really believes in God—Christians or members of any other faith community. Christians who say, “I believe in God,” actually mean, “I believe in a particular construct of God that was formed by a particular sub-culture’s reading of a book called The Bible.” That is all that can honestly be said about belief in God. The significant limitations inherent in being human prevent us from understanding, much less believing in, qualities like eternity, infinity, the divine—for that matter, the human.</p>
<p>Christians, or members of any other religious community, will not, of course, stop saying, “I believe in God.” There aren’t many good alternatives to “God,” and they tend to range from the impossible-to-say to the impossible-to-understand. You know, something along the lines of “that <em>than</em> which a <em>greater cannot be thought.</em>” That’s endearing. Thanks, Anselm. The very fact that it is called the <em>ontological</em> argument pretty much kills it for me. Then there is Matthew Arnold’s “stream of tendency, not ourselves, which makes for righteousness.” I guess I prefer that to Anselm. At least Arnold makes God the good guy/girl/thing/tendency.</p>
<p>Anyway, you get the idea. “I believe in God” may not be true, strictly speaking, but it’s easy to say, and heck, it would work well under pressure—for example, as a last testimony before the pagans chop your head off. Can you imagine trying to say, “I believe in that than which a greater cannot be thought” as the ax is falling?</p>
<p>So then, why say, “I <em>don’t</em> believe in God; God believes <em>in me</em>”? We all know the well-worn story of the alcoholic or drug addict trapped in a cycle of self-destructive behavior, whose life is transformed because someone else “believed in her/him.” It’s a beautiful story that touches people because it reveals something essential about human nature—that the faith and love of an <em>other</em> might change what seems unchangeable in us. The other believes in “me” and stays with “me” in the brokenness. Sometimes that is transformative.</p>
<p>The most addictive and self-destructive behavior in my life has been believing in God. Growing up in the Bible Belt, in a small Fundamentalist church, in a loving, believing family, there was never a time when I didn’t “believe in God”—by which I mean, of course, that “particular construct of God that was formed by a particular sub-culture’s reading of a book called The Bible.” It is almost impossible in that sub-culture to step outside the paradigm—comfortable and secure, beliefs constantly reinforced by reading a book that has been for all practical purposes deified, and interpreting personal experiences through that (particular) reading. That particular reading of the book and understanding of God was <em>who I was</em>—my identity, my worth—not just now, but for <em>eternity</em>. The investment in getting it right was staggering. Then when I was sure I “had it right,” it was almost impossible to consider, and certainly impossible to accept, any proposition outside that construct. I could not, without unbearable stress on my identity, my worth, and on my <em>eternal</em> relationship to God, risk such immense stakes.</p>
<p>I was, in effect, a Biblaholic. No, a Particular-reading-of-the-book-aholic. I was addicted to the particular way I had come to read the book. And I judged God and other people by that standard. And like an alcoholic or drug addict, under the influence I was able to justify saying and believing some pretty awful things about God and other people. But something inside kept pushing back, insisting there had to be another way. And then a door opened. Perhaps someone was knocking. I think someone was. Somehow I walked through. On the other side was peace. On the other side was all of creation, including me, and it was good. A different paradigm. The addiction and self-destructive behavior began to fade. No need to “get it right” so that I could judge God and other people. A relief.</p>
<p>Now, like all recovering addicts, I guard my heart closely to make sure I don’t relapse. And I remember that, if there is God, the path to God is God’s belief in us. And so—John 3:16 (Gary’s Revised Edition): For God so believed in humanity, that God became human, that everyone who was believed in would have life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here’s the scene: A detective—about forty, rugged good looks, speaks the Queen’s English as if he were once a broadcaster on BBC radio, dark clothing, fashionable hair, divorced, one daughter with whom he struggles to communicate, aging belligerent father from whom he feels estranged—returns from the scene of a grisly murder. He becomes immobilized by depression, nearly catatonic, weeping, whining, never sleeps, lives with a hangover, brilliant at solving crimes, but unbearable as a person. As I see it, this is an accurate description of British actor Kenneth Branagh’s interpretation of the fictional Swedish detective Kurt Wallander.</p>
<p>Long before I stumbled onto the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallander_%28UK_TV_series%29">Branagh BBC series</a> <em>Wallander</em>, I had very mixed feelings about Kenneth Branagh—good in Shakespeare, awful in <em>Frankenstein, </em>and so forth. But as a real lover of Scandinavian crime fiction, I was up for giving the <em>Wallander</em> series a shot. After three or four episodes, I had had enough. Great Swedish settings (cold, dark, wet, but beautiful), interesting stories, good supporting cast, but I could not stomach Branagh’s overblown Existential angst in his interpretation of the title character.</p>
<p>The novels from which the <em>Wallander</em> series was created were written by the late Swedish novelist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henning_Mankell">Henning Mankell</a>, who died in 2015. About a year after I abandoned the BBC series, I ran across an inexpensive used copy of one of Mankell&#8217;s Wallander novels and decided to read it. I was not surprised to find really good writing, which is common with the Scandinavian writers, but was delighted to find a title character who was likeable—middle-aged, average looking, a little out of shape, no black clothes, plain hair, divorced, struggling with his relationships with his daughter and aging father. Pensive, a little brooding at times, but a far, far cry from Branagh’s morose, nearly suicidal cop.</p>
<p>Not long after reading the novel, I found a Swedish production of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallander_%28Swedish_TV_series%29"><em>Wallander</em> </a>series on Netflix and thought, why not? It was a jewel of a series&#8211;in Swedish with subtitles. The Swedish lead actor, Kristor Henriksson, an average looking guy, was a perfect balance between pensive and active, brooding and outgoing. No more weeping and whining, just quiet and thoughtful. Still brilliant at solving murders, but also an interesting person. I&#8217;d say that Henriksson saved my Wallander.</p>
<p>I may not in future watch a Kenneth Branagh production of anything. I will continue to read Henning Mankell’s Wallander novels. If you like crime fiction, you need to introduce yourself to Scandinavian crime fiction. Henning Mankell would be a good place to start. The Wallander novels are good reading, and as a bonus you get the Swedish production of the TV series, which captures the best elements of the fiction.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The quiet has a different quality here. It is driven by the rhythm of the surf. The constant washing of the waves on the shore&#8211;not the pounding surf of California, the East Coast, but the lighter, brighter sound of smaller waves. In the mornings, just after sunrise, the waves are subdued. The birds take over, screeching, whistling, chattering. And the doves&#8217; low calling back and forth in the canopy around us.</p>
<p>The sounds don&#8217;t change the fundamental nature of the quiet. We are a mile south of the village of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopkins,_Belize" target="_blank">Hopkins</a> on the southern coast of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belize" target="_blank">Belize</a>, a one hour ferry and three hour bus ride from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caye_Caulker" target="_blank">Caye Caulker</a>. It&#8217;s a small village with only a few shops and bars, maybe three stores. This aging resort with the flamboyant name of &#8220;<a href="http://www.junglejeanie.com/" target="_blank">Jungle Jeanie&#8217;s</a>&#8221; stands alone on this stretch of beach. Whatever nightlife happens in Hopkins does not reach us down the coast. A little further south, several large resorts claim a half mile of shoreline, but their noise also does not register here.</p>
<p>We play a little, relax a lot. We zip lined in the jungle, visited Mayan ruins, kayaked, and paddle boarded. We should have snorkeled, alas. But the deck of the little cabana, pink and stilted, twenty yards from the surf, kept calling us back, luring us into naps and books and cold Belikin Beer, and occasional glasses of One Barrel rum, made in Belize. Or the chair on the beach as the sun set behind us. The frigate-birds, pelicans, sea gulls, and herons. The fish and chicken and pork and rice and beans and plantains and fry jacks and tortillas.</p>
<p>We walk up the surf line to Sandy Beach Restaurant, a half mile or so, where Ms Merlene, a sweet old Belizean woman, grills &#8220;Jack&#8221; fish and serves rice molded into a heart, and beans, always beans, and Belikin Beer. The hot sauce is made by the &#8220;Sandy Beach Women&#8217;s Cooperative Society, Limited,&#8221; Ms Merlene Castillo, Chair Lady. Her beautiful gap-toothed smile and colorful headscarf. We buy a bottle.</p>
<p>And Barbara, an old hippy, living in an ancient school bus a hundred yards off the beach among the palm and papaya trees. Her tiny shop in the front of the bus, &#8220;Sew Much Hemp,&#8221; where she sells hand-sewn hemp clothing and essential oils and natural bug repellent. The smell of citronella and fabric, her gravelly voice and leathery skin, the old dog at the door whining for a touch.</p>
<p>Tonight our last hurrah. A bike ride up to the village for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garifuna_people" target="_blank">Garifuna</a> drumming. No matter how loud the cabana deck calls me, I&#8217;m going to hear the Garifuna drumming.</p>
<p>Tomorrow Belize City. Thursday home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The sea breeze runs through the palms, and the palm fronds whisper and chitter above us. A fresh wind that cools the skin. Sun bright on the water, shades of aquamarine, stretching out to the barrier reef, a long white line of surf before the dark blue deep. Sitting, looking, breathing is a sensual experience. The scent of the sea, the white sand, the scattered kelp along the shore. Our last day on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caye_Caulker">Caye Caulker.</a></p>
<p>Every morning dark Belizean coffee from Maureen at Ice-n-Beans, just behind the grove of palms we idle under. Just before noon a Bellikin Beer, Belize&#8217;s own brew, to cool our palate, stir the belly for lunch. Street vendors&#8211;Kareem at his grill, Raul at his cart, Andre and Chenille at their shack by the street&#8211;the food so good we moan and groan as we eat. Chicken and pork and rice and beans and slaw and plantains and homemade tortillas&#8211;we buy one plate, eat our fill, and give leftovers to the dogs. Five American dollars, nine at the most. Always the talk and laughter with the vendors, and walking away feeling sweet, alive.</p>
<p>Each night the old wooden dock jutting out through the mangroves on the back side of the island into open water. A dozen people sitting and talking quietly, watching the sun slip slowly into the water beyond the sailboats anchored in the bay. A round surge of orange, a bright trail running toward us, the scattered dark grey clouds tinged with pink and red. A Belizean man standing in a flat skiff paddles by, framed by the scene, cameras clicking from the dock.</p>
<p>And tonight, Maurice, a wizard with blackened snapper, honey-brandy sauce, and grilled vegetables, here at Wish Willy&#8217;s in the yard of the cabana. Red and white strings of lights laced above the tables. Music drifting, easy laughter, the smoke from the grill, the aroma of chicken and fish. Everyone sipping a Bellikin. Maurice cruising, slow, keeping it going for thirty people. Island life.</p>
<p>Tomorrow the ferry to the mainland, Belize City, then a bus down to Hopkins, a village on the southern coast, south of Dangriga. I miss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caye_Caulker">Caye Caulker</a>. It got under our skin. That first morning, a week ago, when I woke up and stepped out onto the porch, Marvin, big smile and dreads, raking the sand, said to me, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, be happy.&#8221; So we didn&#8217;t, and we were.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we wake, birds whistle and chirp and screech, a dog barks from somewhere nearby, and the sun lights the top of the palm tree at Wish Willy&#8217;s, the outdoor restaurant in front of the cabana. The mosquito net over the bed billows inward, pushed by the fan we keep aimed our direction most nights. I listen for a while, then get up and make  coffee, rummage around for a little breakfast. Caye Caulker.</p>
<p>Mary Ann gets up, I get a cup of coffee, and we go to the front porch of the cabana, check our email, think about riding bikes down to the south end of the island. Caye Caulker is 4 miles long and 650 yards wide at its widest. The caye is split about halfway down by a water passage cut by Hurricane Hattie. The split, about fifty yards wide, frames the north end of the village, where we are staying. So we are at the northern tip of the southern half of the caye. The Lazy Lizard, an over-the-top tourist bar that we avoid, sits right on the split, a really nice area for swimming.</p>
<p>Maurice, a big Belizean with the standard dreads, who owns and runs Wish Willy&#8217;s and is the husband of Monique, our landlady, comes down the steps from their apartment above the restaurant and gives us a big piece of dark, super rich chocolate cake with pecan sauce, warm and chewy. A mouth explosion that reorients the world for a few seconds. So that&#8217;s where he got the belly. Well earned.</p>
<p>Monique&#8217;s dog Scruffy lies on the porch at our feet. One of three that roam the property, all good natured and keen to be petted. We love that Caye Caulker is so laid back and low key about everything. Development is encroaching here, but the streets are all still sand/dirt, there are no cars, just golf carts, and we can eat at small street stands or from street vendors with just a grill on the side of the road. Lovely local food.</p>
<p>Colors. We love the colors. Bright pink, rich blue, turquoise, startling orange and yellow, green. The houses, shops, signs. The old wood plank docks jutting into the ocean from the sand. The still, green water at the shore, the white line of surf at the barrier reef, the dark blue of the deep water beyond. Sitting in canvas chairs in the shade of a palm at the beach, reading, dozing, looking, walking in the shallows, looking. Morning on the Caye. Di island, Mon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Continuing with the discussion of Jesus and the Jewel in the Lotus mantra from a few days ago, we have the final three syllables of the mantra (<em>pad-me hum</em>) to consider. If you missed my last post, which considered the first three syllables of the mantra (<em>Om man-i</em>), you can find it <a href="http://garyguinn.com/2016/01/11/jesus-and-the-jewel-in-the-lotus/">here</a>. In that post, I said that I prefer the translation by the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p>The first two of those final syllables, <em>pad-me,</em> mean <em>lotus,</em> and  the Dalai Lama says that the lotus symbolizes <em>wisdom</em>. Wisdom is a central tenet in the development of Christianity. <span class="st">The old Apostle Paul said that &#8220;<em>the foolishness of God</em> is wiser than human wisdom.&#8221; </span><em>Sophia </em>is the Greek translation of the Hebrew word for wisdom in the Septuagint. In Catholic theology and in Protestant mysticism, <em>Sophia</em> is the wisdom of God.</p>
<p>So, up to this point, we have <em>Om</em>, which is purity of mind, body, and speech; <em>mani</em>, which is compassion or love; and now <em>padme</em>, which is wisdom. <em>Wisdom </em>is simply too abstract to translate into action, so I take the statement in Proverbs that &#8220;the beginning of wisdom is the fear (reverence) of the Lord,&#8221; and I translate &#8220;reverence&#8221; into <em>faithfulness</em> or <em>trust</em>. Those are terms I can see in action. So when I repeat, to myself or with others, the syllables <em>pad-me, </em>I am yearning for faithfulness and trust&#8211;i.e., faithfulness to &#8220;the way&#8221; and trust in the one to whom the way leads.</p>
<p>The final syllable in the Jewel in the Lotus mantra, <em>hum, </em>is translated by the Dalai Lama as <em>indivisibility</em>, or <em>oneness</em>. The indivisibility of method (compassion) and wisdom. But also the inter-relation or inter-being of all creation. All human beings are inter-related. We are, in a very essential way, one. As a species, we like to think of ourselves as separate from, or above, the rest of creation. Yet we were created from dirt (in the Genesis story), consist mostly of water, must constantly synthesize both air and the flora/fauna to live, and reproduce through a process of cell division, just like everything else in creation. When we die, the atoms that made up our physical form return to the storehouse of nature from which other creatures/things come. Oneness.</p>
<p>Often when I pray, I use the simple translations of the syllables of the Jewel in the Lotus as my mantra. <em>Purity, compassion, faithfulness, oneness</em>. Those are all important words/ideas in the teachings of Jesus. They are words that <em>describe</em> Jesus. We are told to be transformed, to have the mind of Jesus. In the beginning, Christianity was not called &#8220;Christianity.&#8221; It was called &#8220;the Way.&#8221; Jesus is the Way. Meditating on the words of this mantra is one of the ways I try to follow the <em>way. </em>I like to think of Jesus as the Jewel in the Lotus, the Compassion in the Wisdom.</p>
<p><em>Purity, compassion, faithfulness, oneness.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most popular Buddhist mantras is known as <em>The Jewel in the Lotus,</em> consisting of a six-syllable phrase that Jesus would have loved. There is some debate about the exact origin of the mantra, but it appeared in Buddhist teachings as early as the 11th or 12th century. A  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra">mantra</a> is like a short prayer, which tends to be a word or phrase that, when repeated continuously in meditation and worship, has a positive spiritual effect on the worshiper. Christianity has its share of verses, songs, and early prayers that have become mantras. Consider, for example, the <em>Jesus Prayer</em> (&#8220;Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior, have mercy on me, a sinner&#8221;), which is used widely in Christian meditation, especially in the Eastern  Orthodox Church. Or phrases from the <em>Gloria (&#8220;</em>Lord God, Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us&#8221;) or the <em>Phos Hilaron (&#8220;</em>O gracious Light, pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven, O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!&#8221;) or the <em>Te Deum</em> (&#8220;Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts&#8221;)<em>. </em>Or hundreds of verses from both testaments of the Bible.</p>
<p>Buddhist Mantras are frequently not literally translatable into English, or only loosely so. <em>The Flower in the Lotus</em> is translated in different ways, but the translation I love is from the Dalai Lama. It is <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/tib/omph.htm">the translation</a> I think Jesus would affirm. In the original language, the six syllables are &#8220;<em>Om Ma-ni Pad-me Hum</em>.&#8221; The syllable &#8220;<em>Om</em>&#8221; is the essential sound in the Buddhist tradition and has a wide array of applications. It&#8217;s the sound you always see/hear a group of monks chanting in any documentary on Buddhism. It is frequently translated for Westerners as the vibration of the Universe/God, which has no literal translation but has great spiritual power. The Dalai Lama translates it in a simple but profound way as purity of mind, body, and speech. I apply this translation in my own meditations as follows: <em>Think</em> only those thoughts that promote the good, the beautiful, the well-being of others; <em>Do</em> only those acts that are healthy for the body and make physical life good; <em>Speak</em> only those words that comfort, build up, and give dignity to other people/creatures. So the Dalai Lama&#8217;s translation of this simple syllable, <em>Om</em>, offers not just a definition of a word, but a way of life. Every time I sound that <em>Om</em>, to myself or with others, I am asking for purity of mind, body, and speech.</p>
<p>The next four syllables&#8211;<em>mani padme</em>&#8211;are generally translated as &#8220;jewel&#8221; (mani) and &#8220;lotus&#8221; (padme), hence the name of the mantra. The Dalai Lama considers the  jewel to be a symbol of altruism, compassion, and love. The lotus symbolizes wisdom. If we want to become like a Buddha, or like Jesus, these four syllables represent the path, the way. Compassion combined with Wisdom. Every time I sound the syllables <em>Mani</em>, to myself or with others, I open myself to compassion&#8211;from the Latin, <em>com + pati (</em>with + suffer) to suffer with. To suffer with those who suffer, to experience the deep sympathy that leads to action to relieve suffering. Consider Paul&#8217;s beautiful hymn to selfless love in I Cor 13.</p>
<p>Well, since I try to keep these postings to about 500 words maximum, I&#8217;m going to deal with the last three syllables of the mantra (<em>pad-me hum</em>), and why Jesus would love the whole thing, in another post, in a few days.</p>
