		<description><![CDATA[Nice thoughts!  I am just now getting into Joyce, with plans to read (for the first time) Ulysses this summer.  Often because it has been you either love Joyce or Virginia Woolf, I have sided with Woolf more deeply; but I won&#039;t buy into that kind of either/or thinking!  Cheers, friend.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Karen, I agree completely that college age people have trouble appreciating The Dead, or for that matter, any of the stories in Dubliners. These stories were where Joyce poured his incredible ear for language and conversation and his deep understanding of the monumental impact of the small decisions people make at every turn, especially the emotional impact. I love the stories. And I agree with your reading of The Dead, especially your understanding of Gabriel as insecure and of his wife as trapped in her melancholy nostalgia and regret. I loved the spinster aunts and, yes, even Lilly. Thanks for your thoughts.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I was in college I took a novel course each semester so that I would have reading scheduled into my days.  These courses were never my strongest, and most of the time I was too intimidated to open my mouth in class.  At some point I had to read James Joyce but found him somewhat daunting.  Either my mind has matured or The Dead is one of Joyce’s easier works.  I do think a younger person might not understand the complexities of being married with children.  Gabriel, predisposed to insecurity, projects his own comparisons of himself with the young Michael Furey onto his wife and then spirals into disappointment and morose self-absorption.  In fact, it is quite possible that his wife is upset because she did not love the young man and she mourns his early, needless death.   It would be interesting to read the same story from the perspectives of several of the other characters with their own individual realities—the wife, the two spinster aunts, Mary Jane, or even Lily.  I love having this opportunity to think!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Roger. Facing ourselves honestly, confronting the truth that most of the &quot;being&quot; we project into the world is illusory, is in fact a false self created by that world, and yet still being able to love ourselves and commit to finding our true self, is for me the greatest challenge any human being faces. It&#039;s what both Christianity and Buddhism have described as dying to the old self and becoming a new person by following the source of truth (Christ/Buddha). I too find this process fascinating.
Great to hear from you on this, as always and on any thought at all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m enjoying this blog, Gary.  Very interesting.  I, too, love the Dubliners.  The idea that we create fictions of ourselves is fascinating.  Self-deception can, at times, be very dangerous and sometimes it helps us get by.  Keep up the great blogging.]]></description>
