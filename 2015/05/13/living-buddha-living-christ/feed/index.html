		<description><![CDATA[Wow, Gary!  What a powerful testimony you have posted here, and I LOVE it.  My walk was frankly very tested by living in the area where you and I met and by many people who called themselves Christian.  I do believe most were sincere believers, although some used it to bully and abuse those who were different or suspected of being different.  Grace Episcopal helped me to peace with both my faith and my fellowship down there.  If I had not gone through my years there, I would not be the man and Christian I am today, and I thank God (and folks like you) for that journey.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Shelley! Boy, do I identify with what you said about thinking bad thoughts about radical conservatism. It&#039;s a daily struggle for me. But I am learning from Thich Nhat Hanh that real dialogue only occurs when both parties are willing to listen deeply and respectfully. That is very hard for me when I hear Christians spouting views that are so far from the loving, inclusive Jesus that I try to follow. But, hey, I have to love myself even when I&#039;m being angry with those folks or think bad thoughts about them. Changing our hearts is a long process. And I&#039;m not responsible for their hearts, only for mine. 
It was great to hear from you. Thanks for your thoughts. And say hi to Dan and Sadie (who must be a teenager giving you grey hairs by now).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Scarlett. I dismissed Christianity for quite some time, though I still pretended to follow. Finally it was, as with Thich Nhat Hanh, finding people who reflected the non-judgmental and truly inclusive love of Jesus that allowed me to provisionally believe again. So I really identify with what you say here. The book I&#039;m commenting on, Living Buddha, Living Christ, addresses that issue of exclusiveness beautifully. And I have found that Grace Episcopal Church is a place where everyone is welcomed and loved--believers, non-believers, believers of very different stripes, gay, straight, men, women--it doesn&#039;t matter. So there is hope. 
On a similar note, that old straw about being &quot;saved&quot; at some particular time, being &quot;in&quot; while the &quot;unsaved&quot; are &quot;out,&quot; has gone far by the wayside for me. Nobody is saved. We are all being saved, some more apparently than others, through the gradual dying to our old illusions, instilled into us by our culture (including the church), and being &quot;reborn&quot; into our true selves, by following the source of love. For me, that source is Jesus (and Buddha). For Thich Nhat Hanh that source is Buddha (and Jesus). And it&#039;s a process, not an event. 
Keep the faith. Love is real. Thanks for your thoughts.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve certainly been struggling with my knee-jerk reaction to dismiss Christianity. I&#039;m still a follower at my core, both because of my church community and because that is the way I was raised. However, I have a bitterness in me against faith and religion. Not because I&#039;ve been burned or because of some vendetta, but because at its core, Christianity is taught as an exclusive faith that doesn&#039;t leave much room for people of other faiths who are often much more devout followers (and potentially people) than I&#039;ll ever be. Yet because I&#039;m baptized or have at one point called Jesus my savior, I&#039;m &quot;saved&quot; and others are damned. This makes me frustrated and cold towards the spirituality I&#039;m considered to be a part of. I honestly want Christianity to see itself as one of many ways to God, but I&#039;m afraid that is an impossible thing to hope for.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gary! Not listening to conservative views, and dismissing them as just, well, stupid, is something that I do that I KNOW is not loving. I struggle with this every day as I continue to work within a church-owned college that is taking it good-old-time warming up to the radical idea of Jesus: INCLUSION! And I know I don&#039;t have respect for my parent&#039;s conservative views (Fox News on a loop 8 hours a day...)--I dismiss them as uneducated and unwilling to accommodate any new information they might hear on this journey of faith. I. HEAR. YOU. Thanks for posting this. Miss you and MaryAnn!
