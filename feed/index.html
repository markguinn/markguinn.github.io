<p>Takashi Hiraide&#8217;s short novel The Guest Cat (136 pages)  is difficult to categorize. Hiraide is a well-known Japanese poet, and this little book reads like an Imagist poem. Each of the twenty-nine short chapters is itself an image, or a tableau, that adds a piece to the larger puzzle. The chapters at times seem almost independent of the story. At times, they meander into brief musings on philosophy, art, music, and science. And though none of these musings points the reader directly toward interpretation of the story, they are all weighted with meaning. Hiraide seems to follow Emily Dickinson&#8217;s dictum to &#8220;tell all the truth, but tell it slant.&#8221; </p>



<p>A young couple, both writers, no children, no pets. A neighborhood cat begins to visit, begins to stay, but never really stays. A surprising turn of events changes the lives of the young couple. The plot of the novel could be summarized in just a few sentences, but the layering of images, events, and emotions&#8211;as in any good imagist work&#8211;creates a rich fabric of possibilities. The Guest Cat is a novel, a poem, about love, about vulnerability. It is about the cost of opening your life to the other. </p>

<h3>Penelope Speaks</h3>
<p>Margaret Atwood’s short novel <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Penelopiad-Penelope-Odysseus-PENELOPIAD-Paperback/dp/B00QMNY40G/"><em>The Penelopiad</em></a>, a retelling of Homer’s <em>The Odyssey</em> from the perspective of Penelope. With the help of the Twelve Maids, the story becomes a delightful romp. Atwood offers a quasi-Greek drama, with the narrative split between Penelope and the Twelve Maids, who serve as a chorus. Penelope’s voice is deeply ironic, which offers the reader a whole new perspective on the hero Odysseus and on Penelope herself as the archetypical faithful wife.</p>
<h3>Characters and Irony</h3>
<p>Atwood uses not only Homer’s <em>Odyssey</em> but also certain critical issues that surround that work, along with her own questions about Homer’s treatment of Penelope and the Twelve Maids, to mine the ancient material for a wide range of humorous possibilities. The son, Telemachus, is a spoiled brat. The faithful old servant, Eurycleia, is an interfering busybody, referred to as “the trusted cackle-hen.” The chorus of maids enters regularly, performing in a different genre each time—a rope-jumping rhyme, a lament, a popular tune, an idyll, a sea shanty, and so forth. And though Penelope maintains her iconic role as innocent and faithful wife throughout, the truth of her narrative is undercut by her own ironic tone and by various accusations made by the chorus along the way.</p>
<h3>A View from Hades</h3>
<p>One of the most enjoyable moves Atwood makes is to place Penelope in Hades while she tells the tale. The opening line of the book is “Now that I’m dead, I know everything.” This allows Atwood to make two additional narrative moves that add humorous layering to the tail. In Hades, Penelope meets various other characters from <em>The Odyssey</em>, including Helen, the cause of all Penelope’s troubles, one of the suitors slaughtered by Odysseus, and the Twelve Maids. Additionally, she narrates the story from current time, contemporary with the reader, a fact the reader only gradually becomes aware of, which allows her to make ironic comments about our times, her times, and times in between.</p>
<h3>Vintage Atwood</h3>
<p>For readers who are familiar with Homer’s <em>Odyssey</em> and who enjoy an ironic and iconoclastic voice, <em>The Penelopiad</em> will be a fun read. It’s quite different from Margaret Atwood’s better known and more serious work, but it’s vintage Atwood nonetheless.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><em>Two Girls Down</em></h3>
<h4>Plot:</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/26872.Louisa_Luna">Louisa Luna</a><em> </em>opens her novel<em> Two Girls Down</em> with the kidnapping of two sisters, Kylie and Bailey, ten and eight years old. Their mother has popped into a K-Mart for a few minutes, leaving the girls in the car. When she returns, the girls are gone. Frantic search. Police. Code Adam alert. Nothing. No trace. Enter Alice Vega, wild woman, free-lance missing-person finder, and Cap, ex-cop turned private detective. Vega became an overnight star when she recovered a high-profile child, and has been in demand ever since by people whose loved ones have disappeared. The police are not happy to have her involved in the case.</p>
<p>The grandmother of Kylie and Bailey asks Vega how many of the children she has she has gone after have been successfully found. Vega tells her <em>all of them</em>. One hundred per cent. The caveat, and the terrifying reality that drives the tension in the novel, is that not all were alive when she found them, and a few who were found alive were dead in other ways, scarred beyond repair by the experience. <a href="http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Two-Girls-Down.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-798 size-medium" src="http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Two-Girls-Down-198x300.jpg" alt="Cover photo Two Girls Down" width="198" height="300" srcset="http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Two-Girls-Down-198x300.jpg 198w, http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Two-Girls-Down.jpg 313w" sizes="(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px" /></a></p>
<p>When Vega calls on Cap to help her find Kylie and Bailey, the search lures him from his relatively safe and boring work breaking up bad marriages exposing unfaithful spouses. As an ex-cop, he is capable of handling the danger of the job Vega offers him, and the possibility of a little excitement stirs some of the old cop adrenalin.</p>
<h4>Writing:</h4>
<p>Luna’s writing is strong. When we first meet Vega, she is doing a yoga handstand and thinking about the danger of not knowing what is just beyond your vision. “Her old boss in fugitive recovery, Perry, used to call it Little Bad and Big Bad. Little Bad was the teenager on the front porch with a Phillips screwdriver tucked into his pants. Big Bad was his daddy waiting inside with a loaded .38 and a pissed-off pit bull. There was always a worse thing that you couldn’t see, and it was closer than you thought.” When Cap meets the mother of the lost girls at a bar for an interview, the narrator tells us, “He looked at Jamie’s hands on the bar, lying there like leaves of a dead plant, and did not extend his.”</p>
<h4>Characters:</h4>
<p>Though the writing style is strong, the strongest element of the novel is the characters. The two leads are interesting and complex. Luna vividly draws the supporting characters—the mother, Cap‘s daughter, the police—who are strong in their own right. Cap‘s daughter, Nell, is, in fact, almost a show-stealer—smart, sassy, loving.</p>
<h4>Pace:</h4>
<p>The pacing in <em>Two Girls Down</em> is compelling. The build-up is quick, with the kidnapping kicking the conflict into gear immediately, and the intensity develops steadily right up to the powerful ending. I&#8217;d compare it to <em>Black-Eyed Susans</em>, by Julia Haeberlin (See my review <a href="http://garyguinn.com/2017/11/15/review-black-eyed-susans-julia-haeberlin/">here</a>). And laced through the action and suspense, Louisa Luna offers the reader the possibility of romance. What more can you ask?</p>

This piece of music &#8211; the most well known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viennese_Waltz">Viennese Waltz</a> of all time &#8211; and of course the Viennese Waltz itself &#8211;  would become my lifetime ambition! <a href="http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Johann-Strauss.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-789 size-medium" src="http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Johann-Strauss-194x300.jpg" alt="Photo of Johann Strauss" width="194" height="300" srcset="http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Johann-Strauss-194x300.jpg 194w, http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Johann-Strauss-768x1191.jpg 768w, http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Johann-Strauss-660x1024.jpg 660w, http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Johann-Strauss-676x1048.jpg 676w, http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Johann-Strauss.jpg 1519w" sizes="(max-width: 194px) 100vw, 194px" /></a></p>
<p>Here’s the thing &#8211; I have never been a dancer. But somehow, at 52, I felt the buzzing in my veins, the urge in my feet, and the rhythm in my body.</p>
<p>I phoned my local dance school in trepidation. Was I too old at 52,  I asked? Silly question of course – their oldest member is 91!</p>
<p>Any dance to me, is good dance.  But it was the Viennese Waltz that always took my imagination. That glitzy, floaty, whirly, twirly, ultimate fantasmagorical, fairy tale dance.</p>
<p>Could I do that?</p>
<p>Would I ever do that?</p>
<p>Who would do it with me?</p>
<h4>Inspiration:</h4>
<p>As a child I had tap-tapped my heart out in any open space I could find, most often on a deserted railway station platform. Thinking no-one could see me, I would flit up and down off the benches and pirouette beside the Ladies Toilets. Why did I think no one could see me? Only a child could answer that.</p>
<p>Edward was my inspiration to fulfil my Viennese Waltz dream. When we met during my Dating Daisy, internet dating escapades, I found he shared my fascination for dance. His mother had been a ballerina. He was a pianist and a sportsman. He had natural ability, athleticism and musicality. Here I found my Fred Astaire. We had started dance lessons together as soon as we met and were having the time of our lives, dancing everywhere and anywhere as often as we could possibly do so.</p>
<p>My mind was racing faster than my feet. Could we get to Vienna, to a Viennese Ball, to do a real Viennese Waltz in a real Viennese Ballroom? &#8230; Yes, we could. And it would be a Christmas present! The best Christmas present I could possible imagine for us both!</p>
<p>I did it – in true Daisy fashion. I bought tickets for the Johann Strauss Valentine’s Ball at the Kursalon Palace on 13<sup>th</sup> February 2016. It was  July when I booked the tickets, and I kept it a secret for a whole 5 months! Yes – I told a few friends at the dance school, but they were sworn to secrecy!</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve we went to bed and I couldn’t sleep. Roughly once an hour, I poked Edward in the ribs and asked what the time was.</p>
<p>“It’s only an hour since you last asked,”  he groaned wearily – “Please can we get some sleep! &#8230; “</p>
<p>“I can’t sleep,” I whispered – “I’m just so excited to give your present!”</p>
<p>I think it was about 6.30am, when he finally capitulated and turned on the bedside lamp. With childlike enthusiasm I thrust my gift at him. He had to open the card first. I had bought and assembled one of those cards which when you open it up, plays a tune! And Yes, I stuck a  picture of a beautiful couple Viennese waltzing onto the front of it. And when you opened it up – you probably guessed this! – <em>Yes it did play the Blue Danube</em>!</p>
<p>Edward was suitably overjoyed – but in typical male fashion after a few hullabaloos – he did go back to sleep! (By the way &#8211; I was not fazed by his present  for me – which we laughed about afterwards – was  a  box of soap! He is very generous to me all the time – but not present minded shall we say! – I just think it’s funny!)</p>
<h4>Holiday of a Lifetime:</h4>
<p>Fast  forward to February 2016. This turned out to be a holiday of a lifetime. We flew to Vienna on Austrian Airlines, and were presented on the aircraft with a beautiful breakfast of homemade pastries and champagne, courtesy of our hotel, The Do &amp; Co, a sumptuous hotel situated right in St Stephen’s square, opposite the Cathedral. A limousine escorted us from the airport, something I had not specifically requested and was a fabulous surprise. Our hotel room was exquisite. Having recently been refurbished, the furnishings were lavish and so comfortable.</p>
<p>The breakfasts we had in that hotel were undoubtedly the best I have ever had anywhere in the world. Our personal chef cooked us smoked salmon and scrambled eggs, while we drank freshly squeezed orange and banana juice, and groaned over the mouth watering homemade breads, cinnamon whirls, chocolate brownies and apple Danish pastries. (I’ve no idea how Austria does not have the fattest population in the world!)</p>
<p>Everything about Vienna is still vibrant in my mind. If you have never visited the city I can’t recommend it highly enough. I’m focussing on dance in this article, and we had two, two hour Viennese waltz lessons the two days before the ball, in a Viennese Dance School. BUT, Vienna is famous for coffee shops and delicious Sachertorte – and we certainly fitted in more of these than we should have done!</p>
<p>The night of the Ball we dressed with great care and sophistication. I had chosen a full length gold dress, satin with a taffeta overlay. I curled my long hair, adorned myself with jewels, wore a fur cape with a diamante clasp and my new high heeled gold dance shoes. Edward wore his Black formal Dinner Suit, with a gold cummerbund and bow tie. We were a real life Cinderella and Prince Charming off to the Ball!</p>
<p>The most embarrassing thing I recall was having to walk across the pedestrian precinct in our attire, as there is no vehicular access directly to the hotel for taxis! &#8211; So we walked to our taxi, picking our way, myself in my high heels,  through crowds of tourists snapping photographs and thronging in the plaza. I felt very self conscious!</p>
<p>The Kursalon Palace lit up the night sky.  We walked through the majestic entrance and were greeted with rows of waiters and waitresses with trays of champagne. Many were in traditional Austrian dress and we were invited to take pictures. I spoke to a lady standing next to me, and it turned out she and her husband were English. Soon, a few other English speaking couples had joined us. There was a couple from Ireland, and four young people from Australia. <a href="http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kursalon-palace.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-790 size-medium" src="http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kursalon-palace-300x137.jpg" alt="The Kursalon Palace" width="300" height="137" srcset="http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kursalon-palace-300x137.jpg 300w, http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kursalon-palace.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Inside the palace there were 3 ball rooms. We were seated in one of these for our meal, which was a beautiful banquet. The dinner was served, the wine flowed, the company was sparkling and we were all eagerly waiting for the dancing to start.  Eventually, the orchestra struck up and we all left our seats and crowded round the dance floor. The debutantes danced onto the floor and displayed their routine. It was mesmerising. We clapped and clapped &#8230; and then &#8230; suddenly &#8230; the moment we had been waiting for!</p>
<p>Yes &#8211; you got it – One, Two, Three, &#8230; One,  Two,  Three &#8230; the Blue Danube!</p>
<p>We ran to the dance floor in high anticipation! This was it! &#8230;</p>
<p>BUT&#8230; What was this?! &#8230; something we had never anticipated! &#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;  The dance floor was jam packed, and in fact so crowded we were squeezed in like sardines! Viennese Waltz? &#8230; We could hardly breathe in and out! &#8230; As we soon discovered, there was no way you could do a Viennese Waltz at a Viennese Ball &#8230; just because there were just too many Viennese people on the dance floor!! It was a shock realisation!</p>
<p>In truth, as the evening wore on, and people drank too much,  got tired and went home, the dance floor thinned out, and yes, we did do some Viennese Waltz! The orchestra  also played other dance music too, so were able to dance all our Ballroom and Latin routines &#8211; and of course visit the disco upstairs! But it was a sad truth, that we did far more Viennese Waltz in our two dance lessons before the Ball, than we ever did when we were actually there!</p>
<h4>Reflections:</h4>
<p>Reflections? &#8230; I loved it. I want to do it again! That night, I did eventually manage to do enough Viennese Waltz to feel I had lived the dream!  The  feeling of dressing up and being a princess for a night is such a precious memory. I savour it, and bring it out whenever I feel sad. Memories are something so special, as they can never be erased – these memories will be with me forever.  And that’s what Edward calls me now &#8230; ‘precious!’</p>
<p>Yes, in my life,  Johan Strauss has a lot to answer  for!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Black-Eyed Susans:<a href="http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Black-Eyed-Susans.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-784 size-medium" src="http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Black-Eyed-Susans-199x300.jpg" alt="Book Cover Black-Eyed Susans" width="199" height="300" srcset="http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Black-Eyed-Susans-199x300.jpg 199w, http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Black-Eyed-Susans.jpg 315w" sizes="(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px" /></a></h3>
<p>“The Susans are a greedy plant, often the <em>first</em> to thrive in scorched, devastated earth.” This line, early in <a href="http://juliaheaberlin.com/">Julia Heaberlin</a>’s novel <em>Black-Eyed Susans</em>, works on more than one level and becomes an underlying motif for the narrative. Tessa Cartwright was raped and left for dead as a teenager among a field of flowering black-eyed Susans. The bones of other long-lost girls surrounded her. In the media coverage of the case, she and the other girls become known as the Black-Eyed Susans. Out of her scorched and devastated life, Tessa has managed to thrive.</p>
<h3>Tessa:</h3>
<p>The attack itself remains an empty spot scorched in Tessa’s memory. The novel opens years later, when Tessa has a teenage daughter of her own. She is working with an attorney and a forensic scientist to free the man convicted of the crime, who sits on death row awaiting imminent execution. Though she can’t remember the attacker, she has become convinced that her testimony at the trial sent the wrong man to death row. Underlying the race to save the condemned man is the possibility that the real killer is now stalking Tessa.</p>
<h3>The Voices:</h3>
<p>Two voices tell the story—the first-person voice of the present-day Tessa, and the first-person voice of her earlier self, the young Tessie in the months after the attack. The voices alternate in short chapters of three to five pages, creating a dynamic pace in the complex and gripping narrative. The two narrative voices press against each other, one from the past and one from the present. The tension grinds inevitably toward the final revelation, squeezing out the truth that lurks behind the Black-Eyed Susans.</p>
<h3>Supporting Cast:</h3>
<p>Tessa’s teenage daughter, the defense lawyer, and the forensic scientist are engaging and well-developed characters and become important pieces in solving the puzzle, as does Tessa’s best friend from childhood, who disappeared years earlier after the trial. And always, the voices of the other Susans in Tessa’s head, the dead girls who encourage, warn, and challenge her.</p>
<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>Some readers may find the resolution of the mystery a bit contrived, maybe a little far-fetched. I did. But that won’t take away from a really good story told very well. As in the case of the Nordic Noir novel <em><a href="http://garyguinn.com/2017/09/30/767-edwardson/">Sun and Shadow</a></em>, by Ake Edwardson, the flaws do not outweigh the strengths. I don’t hesitate to recommend the book.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Introduction: Ishiguro</h3>
<p>Memory and the heart. Such fragile things on which to build our notion of ourselves. As the old prophet Jeremiah said, “The heart is deceitful above all things . . . Who can understand it?” And memory is surely at least as deceitful as the heart. Both memory and the heart seem to function at the mercy of the transient, ephemeral world of human life. And they are central to the fiction of Japanese writer Kazuo Ishiguro, who  just won the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/topic/Kazuo-Ishiguro/112573945420455?source=whfrt&amp;position=1&amp;trqid=6473416320045287723">2017 Nobel Prize for Literature</a>. <img class="alignright" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/3377/production/_98157131_ishepa.jpg" alt="Kazuo Ishiguro photo" width="452" height="254" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28922.An_Artist_of_the_Floating_World"> <em>An Artist of the Floating World</em></a> is a beautiful emotional set piece. Following World War II, an aging Japanese artist struggles with his experience of post-war Japan. In time, he regrets his role in the rise of empire that ended in the destruction of the old world.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Comparison: <em>Remains of the Day</em></h4>
<p><div style="width: 454px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/14D1B/production/_98157258_remains_of_the_day_shutterstock.jpg" alt="Remains of the Day film still Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins" width="444" height="250" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins in Remains of the Day.</p></div></p>
<p>It may be that most people know Kazuo Ishiguro for his novel <em>The Remains of the Day</em> and its film adaptation, with Anthony Hopkins as the butler Stevens and Emma Thompson as Miss Kenton. In fact, there are significant similarities in tone and theme between the two novels. In both cases, the main character looks back on a career in which he devoted his life to a cause that was later shown to be horribly mistaken and in which he turned his back on a path that would have resulted in a different, and probably more fulfilling life. Mr. Stevens, in <em>The Remains of the Day</em>,  does not marry Miss Kenton. In <em>An Artist of the Floating World</em>, the artist Masuji Ono turns his back on “fine art.&#8221; Fine art focuses on the fleeting beauty of this world. Ono  makes his art serve the empire of the “New Japan.”</p>
<p>Both novels come from a perspective not long after the war. The protagonists look back on a time prior to and during the war, blended with their current lives. The tone of both is nostalgic, beautiful. In <em>An Artist of the Floating World</em>, Ishiguro’s use of an unreliable narrator, whose growth in the novel is toward self-realization, is masterful. Numerous times in the narrative, the artist Ono says it is entirely possible that his memory of an event or conversation is not accurate, that things might not have happened exactly as he presents them. These admissions become part of his growth in awareness of self. They are some of the elements that make him sympathetic and human, and very like all of us.</p>
<h4>Conclusion: Catharsis<img class="alignleft" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e1/ArtistOfTheFloatingWorld.jpg/220px-ArtistOfTheFloatingWorld.jpg" alt="ArtistOfTheFloatingWorld.jpg Cover" width="169" height="266" /></h4>
<p>A reader who identifies with Ono, and feels compassion for him, may experience in reading this novel what Aristotle called <em>catharsis</em> in his <em>Poetics</em>, a vicarious purging of guilt and fear, the impetus toward self-understanding.<a href="http://garyguinn.com/2017/03/"> (See Aristotle on Character)</a>  Ishiguro seems to be saying that as we grow older, we come to realize how much of our image of ourselves is dependent on feeling and memory, and we come to understand how fickle, how deceitful, those things can be. If we are to live in peace with ourselves, we must see ourselves honestly and forgive ourselves. We have all committed well-intentioned errors in our pasts. Only with honesty and forgiveness can we live with integrity and dignity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Overview <img class="alignright" src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRr0XY7quhAglxKo0j02o9zDxmpHQRgZeMSYOHyUZz6DoRGMV6j" alt="Cover photo of Edwardson, Sun and Shadow" width="369" height="581" /></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/622818.Sun_and_Shadow"><em>Sun and Shadow</em>, </a>the first Detective Erik Winter novel by Swedish writer Ake Edwardson to be translated into English (1999), is a dark psychological mystery that chronicles two grotesque double murders and the exhausting investigation that follows. The plot is complex, and it delivers the build-up to a suspenseful ending.  (See review of <a href="http://garyguinn.com/2017/07/"><em>The Preacher, </em></a>by Sander Jaboksen)</p>
<h3>Edwardson&#8217;s Style: Dialogue, Description, Verbs, Filtering</h3>
<h4>Dialogue-</h4>
<p>Edwardson’s style is literary. The writing is strong, especially the descriptive language and the dialogue. After Detective Winter visits his father, who has just had a heart attack and with whom Winter has had a strained relationship, he tells his lover, Angela, about it:</p>
<p>“ What was it like, seeing him again?”</p>
<p>“As if we’d been chatting only last week.”</p>
<p>“Sure?”</p>
<p>“Depends what you mean. We spoke about safe subjects.”</p>
<p>“Everything takes time. He has to get better first.”</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>“Are you tired?”</p>
<p>“Not so tired that I can’t indulge in a glass of duty-free whiskey. What about you?”</p>
<p>These spare conversations, circling around a subject like a dance, are common. In effect, dialogue carries the narrative.</p>
<h4>Description-</h4>
<p>Edwardson avoids extensive descriptive passages that tend to slow the narrative movement. Yet often the descriptive language is strong. Here is an example of a strong and spare description:</p>
<p>“It was night in the apartment, no lights burning anymore. A standard lamp had been on all day, but the bulb had gone. As dawn broke, autumn sidled in through the venetian blinds and a roller blind in the bedroom let in patches of light.”</p>
<p>I <em>would</em> quibble with a couple of things (pet peeves of mine) in Edwardson’s style. (I should add here that it’s entirely possible that the first of these problems results from translation and may not exist in the original.)</p>
<h4>Verbs-</h4>
<p>First, Edwardson works the poor, overused verb “to be” to within an inch of its life, both as the main verb in a sentence and as the helping verb used with a main verb in the “–ing” (progressive) form. I’ll italicize examples in the following short paragraph to demonstrate:</p>
<p>“Winter <em>was walking</em> along the Ricardo Soriano. It <em>was</em> evening again. He went into the cerveceria Monte Carlo and ordered a glass of draft beer at the bar. The place <em>was</em> full of men watching a football match on a large screen. Real Madrid versus Valladolid. He drank his beer and felt comfortable among all the shouting. There <em>were</em> no women inside the bar. They <em>were sitting</em> at tables on the pavement outside, waiting for the match to end and the evening to begin.”</p>
<p><em>Five</em> “to be” verbs in a short paragraph. The problem: All these “to be” verbs kill the immediacy of the reader&#8217;s experience of what happens. Compare the following possibilities: “Winter walked along  . . . “ or “The bar overflowed with men watching . .” or “All the women sat at tables on the pavement outside . . .” Revising “to be” verbs into action verbs is a staple of good writing.</p>
<h4>Filtering-</h4>
<p>My second quibble: Edwardson tends to <em>filter</em> sense experience instead of giving it to the reader directly. Here’s what I mean. Detective Winter goes into a bar, and the narrator tells us: “Winter could hear people speaking Norwegian, Swedish, and German.” The readers should <em>experience the bar</em>, not have Winter <em>experience it for them.</em> It would be easy to revise this passage to say, “People at the tables around him spoke Norwegian, Swedish, and German.” That way the reader experiences the polyglot <em>with</em> Winter instead of being told that Winter experienced it. This kind of filtering is too common in the novel.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Okay, with all that said, this book was a good read. I recommend it, especially for fans of Scandinavian crime fiction. It’s a strong example of the genre. The complex plot builds slowly and in the end delivers a powerful, driving finish.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>What&#8217;s in a Name?</h3>
<p>Juliet tells Romeo that nothing’s in a name. “That which we call a rose, by any other name, would smell as sweet,” she says. And even Hamlet seems dismissive in his “words, words, words.” But after the Great American Eclipse, I must rebuff the beautiful maiden and challenge the churlish prince. <em>Au contraire</em> sweet Juliet. And as for Hamlet, well, a noble mind o’erthrown, and so forth.</p>
<h3>The Great American Eclipse</h3>
<p>Monday afternoon, August 21st, my friend George and I watched the moon creep through those final degrees toward <a href="http://www.gotscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Totality_edited.jpg">totality</a>. The two of us and our wives were on a quest. Thousands of people rested in lawn chairs or lay on blankets before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MissouriCapitol.jpg">capitol building</a> in Jefferson City, MO. On the stage, set up on the capitol steps, the Fort Leonard Wood military orchestra performed. Kids tossed footballs, played in the fountains, chased each other through the obstacle course of resting adults. Clouds drifted lazily by, bringing with them some unease about missing the Great American Eclipse.  <a href="http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Totality_edited.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-763 size-medium" src="http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Totality_edited-300x167.jpg" alt="photo of totality in the great american eclipse" width="300" height="167" srcset="http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Totality_edited-300x167.jpg 300w, http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Totality_edited-768x428.jpg 768w, http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Totality_edited-1024x570.jpg 1024w, http://garyguinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Totality_edited-676x376.jpg 676w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>But when the final seconds ticked into totality, all eyes stared at the clear blue sky, and a roar went up from the multitude. Then just as quickly, the roar died into silence. Awestruck, we listened to the cicadas wailing in the mid-day dark. The bright corona flared around the black ball of the sun. It was an <em>eclipse</em>, but suddenly that word, which had been <em>mundane</em>, even <em>common, </em>was charged with <em>mystery</em> and <em>awe</em>. It had put on a stunning new mantle.</p>
<h3>Words, Words, Words</h3>
<p>A few minutes later George asked, “What word would describe the eclipse? What word would best communicate something beyond the ordinary, beyond the natural?” We rejected the word “supernatural” immediately as far too tired and burdened with the clutter of history. A dictionary reveals the problem: <em>Supernatural: of or relating to an order of existence beyond the visible observable universe; especially, of or relating to God or a god, demigod, spirit, or devil; departing from what is usual or normal especially so as to appear to transcend the laws of nature:  attributed to an invisible agent (such as a ghost or spirit).</em> Nope, just doesn’t fit. What we had seen was governed entirely by the laws of nature.</p>
<p>The term <em>preternatural</em> offered itself, and we thought perhaps it would work. <em>Preternatural: beyond what is normal or natural, extraordinary, exceptional, uncommon, singular, unprecedented, remarkable, phenomenal, abnormal, inexplicable, unaccountable; strange, mysterious, fantastic</em>. That was more like it. All these words accurately apply to the eclipse. In fact, when taken together, they are, as a whole, a good summary of an <em>abstract</em> description of what happened in the sky above us. But our experience was not abstract in the least.<em> Preternatural</em> would not do.</p>
<h3>The Spiritual</h3>
<p>Each of us had <em>experienced</em> the eclipse as something <em>spiritual</em> (<em>not</em> supernatural), something <em>natural</em> that seemed to stop time, to pull us out of ourselves. And the response of thousands of people gathered there revealed that the immediate, shared human response was not just awe, <em>but joy</em>. A shout, clapping, and <em>laughter</em> erupted. We were all drawn <em>totally</em> into the moment, and in that moment there were no democrats or republicans, no liberals or conservatives, no northerners or southerners, no believers or atheists. There were only human beings sharing an experience of <em>totality</em>, an experience of <em>total</em> self-forgetting, of good will and unity. It must have been what the ancient Israelites felt when they saw God in a whirlwind or pillar of fire.</p>
<h3>And Flannery O&#8217;Connor</h3>
<p>Looking back now, those so-brief two-and-a-half minutes of totality, and the response that followed, tempt me to a bizarre comparison. Forgive the incurable English professor in me, but I think of the words of The Misfit in Flannery O’Connor’s short story “A Good Man Is Hard to Find” after he kills the meddling, bossy grandmother: “She would have been a good woman,” he says, “if it had been somebody there to shoot her every minute of her life.”</p>
<p>Perhaps you can see where this is headed. In some future aeon, after humanity has destroyed itself, I see a cosmic Misfit, sitting on an asteroid, looking down at earth and shaking its head. “They would have been a good species,” it will say, “if it had been a Great American Eclipse to strike them with awe and wonder every minute of their life.”</p>
